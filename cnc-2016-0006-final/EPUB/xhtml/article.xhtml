        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Aim:</strong> To observe the effects of concussion history on cognitive-motor integration in
            elite-level athletes. <strong>Methods:</strong> The study included 102 National Hockey League draft
            prospects (n = 51 concussion history [CH]; n = 51 no history [NC]). Participants completed two
            computer-based visuomotor tasks, one involved ‘standard’ visuomotor mapping and one involved
            ‘nonstandard’ mapping in which vision and action were decoupled. <strong>Results:</strong> We
            observed a significant effect of group on reaction time (CH slower) and accuracy (CH worse), but a
            group by condition interaction only for reaction time (p &lt; 0.05). There were no other deficits
            found. We discussed these findings in comparison to our previous work with non-elite athletes.
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Previously concussed elite-level athletes may have lingering
            neurological deficits that are not detected using standard clinical assessments.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            An estimated 1.6–3.8 million sports-related concussions, or mild-traumatic brain injuries, occur
            annually in the USA; however, the true incidence rate is likely higher due to the number of
            unreported concussions&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref1" epub:type="noteref">1</a>,
            <a href="#ref2" epub:type="noteref">2</a>, <a href="#ref3" epub:type="noteref">3</a>]. Elite athletes are
            not an exception to this phenomenon, and the potential long-term health effects of head injury have recently
            been brought to light through highly publicized litigations within national hockey and football
            leagues&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref4" epub:type="noteref">4</a>]. The Concussion in Sport Group has defined
            concussion as a pathophysiological injury to the brain caused by biomechanical forces, which leads to
            clinical alterations but no structural damage&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]. Concussions result in a graded set
            of clinical symptoms, including physical, cognitive, behavioral and sleep
            disturbances&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref1" epub:type="noteref">1</a>, <a href="#ref5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>].
            Furthermore, concussions can lead to cognitive decline and motor
            deficits&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>, <a href="#ref6" epub:type="noteref">6</a>,
            <a href="#ref7" epub:type="noteref">7</a>]. Using current clinical neuroimaging protocols, no gross
            structural damage can be seen after a concussion&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>]. However,
            there are a number of molecular and metabolic events that occur after injury that may lead to changes in
            brain function&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref8" epub:type="noteref">8</a>]. This ‘neurometabolic cascade’ leads to an
            alteration in ion homeostasis, an increase in free radicals, a decrease in axonal structural integrity and
            ultimately, disruption of axonal transportation&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref8" epub:type="noteref">8</a>].
        </p>
        <p>
            The length of time for complete recovery from a concussion-induced altered metabolic state is not yet well
            understood in humans; however, evidence suggests that during the recovery period the brain may be more
            vulnerable to the effects of a second, or repeated,
            concussion&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref9" epub:type="noteref">9</a>]. In an animal model study by Prins
            <i>et&#x00A0;al.</i>&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref10" epub:type="noteref">10</a>], it was found that repeated
            concussions during this period of vulnerability lead to increased axonal injury, memory impairment and risk
            of mortality. In human studies, it was observed that athletes with a history of three or more previous
            concussions have a threefold higher risk of sustaining another concussion, and have longer recovery
            periods&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref11" epub:type="noteref">11</a>, <a href="#ref12" epub:type="noteref">12</a>].
            Importantly, evidence of increased vulnerability to subsequent concussion during the recovery period
            indicates that returning an athlete to sport too soon after a concussion may put the athlete at greater risk
            for further damage, and increase the potential for second impact syndrome and
            death&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref1" epub:type="noteref">1</a>, <a href="#ref5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>,
            <a href="#ref9" epub:type="noteref">9</a>, <a href="#ref10" epub:type="noteref">10</a>,
            <a href="#ref12" epub:type="noteref">12</a>]. Therefore, there is a need to better understand the underlying
            mechanisms and neurological effects of concussion. From a practical standpoint, such an understanding would
            inform clinicians, charged with making return to play decisions, about the potential for increased
            vulnerability postconcussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Current international protocols recommend that the athletes must be evaluated by a physician and meet
            baseline measurements of both cognitive and motor assessment tools prior to beginning graded physical
            activity progressions&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>]. However, recent studies
            have shown that commonly used assessment tools, such as neurocognitive testing, and the Sport Concussion
            Assessment Tool (SCAT3), may not be sensitive enough to determine if the athlete is safe to return to
            sport&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref1" epub:type="noteref">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">2</a>]. These current evaluation tools measure
            motor and cognitive functions sequentially. In contrast, effective sport performance typically requires
            their simultaneous involvement – thinking and moving at the same time. To be successful in many sports,
            a player must apply a wide range of cognitive factors to each of their movements within the game. For
            example, movements must be made in the context of game-related rules, spatial information regarding the
            locations of other players and prior knowledge of how to best accomplish a given task. Importantly, this
            cognition and action is not done sequentially, but rather, concurrently&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref13">13</a>,
            <a href="#ref14">14</a>]. The necessity of this complex cognitive-motor integration (CMI) during game
            play may help explain why assessment tools that test cognitive and motor functions independently can
            lack the sensitivity required to detect ongoing concussion-related symptoms.
        </p>

        <p>
            CMI can be examined in the laboratory by manipulating the mapping of visual information to a required
            motor response. ‘Standard’ visuomotor mapping involves directly interacting with the object, so that the
            visual stimulus guiding an action is also the target of the action. A common example of this is looking
            at and then reaching for a coffee cup, or a pass in hockey when looking at one’s teammate. In contrast,
            ‘nonstandard’ visuomotor mappings decouple vision and movement, must be learned or calibrated, and
            require integration of spatial or cognitive rules&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref15">15</a>]. A common example of
            a nonstandard visuomotor mapping in daily life is the use of a computer mouse. To successfully use a
            computer mouse, one must slide the hand forward on a horizontal plane in order to move the cursor upward
            on a vertical monitor. In hockey, an example would be passing to one’s teammate on the left, while
            looking and attempting to avoid a body check from an opponent on one’s right. Previous research has
            found changes to the movement kinematics of both the eye and hand as a consequence of decoupling vision
            and movement&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref16">16</a>]. Further, the ability to produce decoupled movements is
            shown to be more vulnerable than the ability to perform standard visuomotor mapping in some forms of
            clinically altered brain function (Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive
            impairment)&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
            With respect to concussion, previous research using nonstandard visually guided arm movements revealed
            differences in performance of collegiate level athletes, adolescents and children with a previous
            concussion compared with control participants without a history of
            concussion&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>]. Significant group differences
            were found in reaction time (RT), movement time, and precision, in that those with a previous concussion
            had performance deficits in both motor planning and execution compared with healthy controls, and this
            was seen more so in the nonstandard task with decoupled vision and action&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref13">13</a>].
            These studies all looked at nonelite level athletes. While current protocols suggest that concussion
            management should be the same for both elite and nonelite athletes&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref5">5</a>], some
            literature suggests that the elite population may be an exception to the standard return-to-play
            protocol&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref19">19</a>]. A study on National Football League (NFL) players, found no
            significant risk of a subsequent injury when returned to sport on the same
            day&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref20">20</a>], while another study noted that professional athletes performed
            better in neuropsychological testing post-concussion compared with nonelite
            athletes&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]. Conversely, it has also been found that retired professional
            contact-sport athletes with a history of repeated concussion had a fivefold prevalence of being
            diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment than their peers with no history of
            concussion&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref22">22</a>]. Therefore it is important to understand the effects of
            concussion in this specialized group, in order to determine effective return-to-play standards. The aim
            of this study is to better understand how a history of concussion affects CMI in the elite athletic
            population. We hypothesize that, similar to the collegiate athletes and youth previously studied in our
            laboratory&#x00A0;[<a class="B13" href="#ref13">13</a>,<a class="B14" href="#ref14">14</a>], testing
            with a nonstandard visuomotor mapping that requires CMI will also reveal performance deficits in the
            young elite-level athlete.

        <section id="methods-participants">
            <h3>Participants</h3>
            <p>
                Participants were selected from the National Hockey League (NHL) draft combine from the 2012–2014
                selection years. All athletes invited to the combine, a total of 322 athletes (mean age 17; all
                identified male), completed the task. Prior to testing, all athletes underwent medical examination with
                a team of physicians who reviewed the medical history of every prospect player and recorded the
                athlete’s self-reported history of concussion. A total of 77 athletes reported at least one previous
                concussion. Athletes who were not medically cleared to participate in sport were excluded from analysis,
                thus all included participants were medically cleared (including vision), asymptomatic, and currently
                participating in sport. Data that were missing or unable to be analyzed due to computer malfunction were
                eliminated from further analysis. Healthy control participants, with no self-reported history of
                concussion, were randomly matched (randperm function; Matlab R2013b, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA)
                to those with a history of concussion from the same collection year (2012, 2013 or 2014). Participants
                who were greater than two standard deviations from the mean for any dependent variable were deemed an
                outlier and removed from further analysis for a total of 102 athletes included in this study; 51 had a
                self-reported history of concussion (mean age 17 years ± 1) and 51 healthy controls (mean age 17 years ±
                1). Information on position, number of previous concussions sustained as well as the length of time (in
                months) since their last concussion was also obtained during the medical examination (see
                <a href="tab1.xhtml">Table 1</a> &amp; <a href="tab2.xhtml">2</a>). All participants completed an
                informed consent, administered through NHL central scouting, provided to the athletes prior to the day
                of testing. Ethics were approved through York University (Toronto, ON, Canada).

        <section id="methods-procedure">
            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <p>
                Participants completed two computer-based visuomotor transformation tasks, one standard and one
                nonstandard (vision and action decoupled). Participants sat at a desk so they could comfortably
                reach a dual-touch-screen 15” laptop (ACER Iconia 6120, Acer America, San Jose, CA, USA)
                allowing for a screen in both the horizontal and vertical planes. In this way the horizontal
                screen was well within the comfortable reach range of the participant while the vertical screen
                was at or slightly below the eye level. In both conditions, participants were instructed to
                slide their index finger of their dominant hand along the touch screen in order to displace a
                cursor from a central target to one of four peripheral targets (up, down, left, right) as
                quickly and as accurately as possible. The central and peripheral targets were viewed on a black
                background to ensure good contrast. Participants guided a crosshair cursor to the yellow central
                (or home) target which would change to green when entered. After 4000 ms, a red peripheral
                target was presented and the central target disappeared, which served as the ‘Go’ signal for
                participants to initiate movements. Once the cursor reached and remained in the peripheral
                target for 500 ms, it disappeared, signaling the end of the trial. The next trial began with the
                presentation of the central target after an intertrial interval of 2000 ms. Peripheral targets
                were located 75 mm from the center target and target diameters were 20 mm. In order to ensure
                smooth movement of the finger during the task, participants wore a capacitive-touch glove on
                their preferred hand.

                    The green circle denotes the central home target in which all movements begin. A red target
                    appears in one of four peripheral directions (90° to top, bottom, left or right of center)
                    after 4000 ms which serves as the ‘Go’ cue. <strong>(A)</strong> The standard condition, in
                    which eye and arm movements are congruent (moved to the same peripheral target).
                    <strong>(B)</strong> The non-standard condition, in which vision and movement are decoupled
                    due to a plane dissociation (eyes look at vertical screen while hand moves along horizontal
                    screen), and visual feedback reversal (cursor movement 180° rotated from hand motion).
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Participants completed the standard and nonstandard conditions in a randomized block design
                (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>). In the standard condition, participants both looked and moved on
                the vertical screen, and directly interacted with the targets. The nonstandard condition
                included two levels of decoupling: plane change, in which participants looked at the vertical
                screen while moving on the horizontal screen, and cue reversal, in which the feedback was
                rotated 180° (i.e.,&#x00A0;in order to move the cursor left, you must slide your finger right).
                Four trials in each of the four directions were completed per condition for a total of 32 trials
                per participant (4 directions × 4 trials × 2 conditions). Participants were instructed to move
                as quickly and accurately as possible, and to look at the targets and not their hands
                (i.e.,&#x00A0;no central fixation). Eye movements were monitored by the experimenter to ensure
                participants were looking at the target; however, a vision tracking system was not used in this
                experiment. The total time to complete the experiment was typically 4–6 min for each participant.
                This was a novel task for all participants, with no practice trials allowed; therefore no
                participant had familiarization of the task. The order of conditions was randomized in order
                to control for potential learning effects.

            <h3>Data processing</h3>
            <p>
                Custom-written (C++) acquisition software sampled the finger’s X-Y screen position at 50 Hz.
                Custom analysis software (Matlab, Mathworks, Inc.) processed individual movement paths with a
                fourth-order (dual pass) low-pass Butterworth filter at 10 Hz. Filtered paths were then used to
                generate a computerized velocity profile of each trial’s movement. The movement onsets and
                ballistic movement offsets (the initial movement prior to path corrections) were scored at 10%
                peak velocity (PV), while total movement offsets were scored as the final 10% PV point once the
                finger position plateaued within the peripheral target. Note that in situations where the
                initial movement successfully brought the finger to the peripheral target, the ballistic and
                total movement offsets would be equivalent. These profiles were then verified by visual
                inspection, and corrections were performed when necessary. Trials were deemed errors if the
                finger/cursor left the center target too early (&lt;4000 ms), RT was less than 150 ms or more
                than 8000 ms or movement time was more than 10,000 ms. Trials in which the first ballistic
                movement exited the boundaries of the center target in the wrong direction (&gt;45° from a
                straight line to target) were coded as direction reversal errors (DR), eliminated from further
                evaluation and were analyzed as separate variable (see below). The scored data were then
                processed to compute nine different movement timing and execution outcome measures, described in
                detail below.

        <section id="methods-movement-timing">
            <h3>Movement timing</h3>
            <p>
                The measured kinematic variables for movement timing were as follows: RT; the time interval
                (milliseconds [ms]) between the central target disappearance and movement onset. Movement time;

                from the individual ballistic movement end points (∑ x/n, ∑ y/n) to the actual target location
                (mm). Variable error (VE, precision); was calculated as the distance between the individual
                ballistic movement end points (σ2) from their mean movement (millimeters; mm). DR errors were

                effects of group (concussion history, control) and condition (standard, nonstandard) were

                Because condition as a factor was significantly different across all variables, we performed

                to test the effects of the number of previous concussions (1, &gt;2), as well as the length of
                time since their last concussion (&lt;12 months, 12–24 months, &gt;24 months) on performance.
                Information as to the number of previous concussions and the length of time since the most
                recent concussion was not available for all participants, these data were coded as missing and

                was analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Correlation of significant variables to both the number of

            Of the total number of athletes tested, 23.9% reported at least one previous concussion. After
            outlier removal, 102 athletes were included in this study, 51 with a previous concussion and 51
            matched healthy controls. Of those who reported a previous concussion, 78.4% (n = 40) reported only
            one prior injury while 19.6% (n = 10) reported two or more (see <a href="tab2.xhtml">Table 2</a>). The
            length of time since their last concussion was distributed among less than 12 months (n = 17; 16.7%),
            between 12 and 24 months (n = 14; 13.7%), or greater than 24 months (n = 16; 14.7%) (see
            <a href="tab2.xhtml">Table 2</a>). The majority of the athletes included in the analysis were forward
            (60.8%, <a href="tab1.xhtml">Table 1</a>). No significant relationship between the proportion of
            concussions sustained and player position was found (χ<sup>2</sup> [4] = 7.457; p = 0.114). Examples

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            This study sought to determine whether young, elite-level athletes with a history of concussion, who
            were asymptomatic and medically cleared of concussion, exhibited CMI impairments. A computer-based
            eye–hand coordination task was used to examine several kinematic variables. Performance deficits in
            arm RT and constant error (accuracy) of arm movement end points were seen in those with a history of
            concussion compared with healthy age-, sex- and skill-matched control participants. The deficit in
            RT was exacerbated in the nonstandard task, where there was dissociation between vision and action
            requiring rule integration to control goal-directed movements. Although this finding supports our
            hypothesis of decreased performance with an increase in task complexity in elite athletes, these
            results differ from our previous findings in collegiate level athletes&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref14">14</a>].
            Specifically, the collegiate level athletes had deficits in multiple variables including both motor
            planning (RT), and motor execution (movement time, precision)&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref14">14</a>]. While
            the elite athletes also show an impairment of motor planning (RT) and execution (accuracy), this was
            seen across fewer variables. Furthermore, while RT was significantly affected by the increase in CMI
            complexity, ballistic accuracy was impaired independent of condition and therefore these deficits
            may not be due to a dysfunction within the specific network tested by our task. The performance
            deficits brought out by testing CMI in this elite sport population were also less severe than those
            observed in previously concussed select-level youth and adolescent athletes, who displayed an even
            greater number of impairments in motor planning and execution (movement time, ballistic path length,
            full path length, accuracy)&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref13">13</a>]. Lastly, unlike our previous observations
            in varsity athletes and select-level youth athletes, the number of previous concussions, the length
            of time since the most recent concussion or the position played did not influence on any of the
            variables tested.
        </p>

    <p>
        Relative to a standard visuomotor mapping, CMI has a greater level of task difficulty due to the
        simultaneous involvement of cognitive and motor systems, which requires intact reciprocal
        connections between the frontal (prefrontal, premotor, primary motor), parietal (superior parietal
        lobule, intraparietal sulcus) and subcortical areas (cerebellum)&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref23">23–27</a>].
        Task complexity has previously been shown to lead to a decrease in performance, specifically in
        RT&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref28">28</a>], while imaging studies have since shown that the involvement of
        different brain regions within this frontoparietal network depend on task complexity&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref24">24</a>,
        <a href="#ref29">29–31</a>]. Previous research in our laboratory found an increase in activity in
        both the inferior parietal lobule and cerebellum during a nonstandard CMI task relative to a
        standard mapping task. Additionally, spatial patterns of activity within the cuneus and medial
        premotor cortex were able to differentiate between the two tasks&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref24">24</a>]. We
        propose that the significant differences in performance between our standard and nonstandard task
        (which were observed in both the concussion and healthy control groups of elite athletes) are due to
        the increased cognitive load, and thus greater activation within the frontoparietal network for the
        nonstandard task.
    </p>

    <p>
        While we observed task-related performance deficits across all participants in the nonstandard task,
        those with a history of concussion tended to demonstrate even greater decrements relative to healthy
        controls. Previous research has looked at the effects of a concussion on performance in both
        standard and simultaneous cognitive motor tasks. A study by Locklin&#x00A0;<em>et&#x00A0;al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref32">32</a>]
        found that athletes with a history of concussion had increased mean response times compared with
        control subjects in a standard mapping reaching task. Although they failed to reach a level of
        significance, they suggested this may be due to the low difficulty of the task. Additionally,
        Hugenholtz&#x00A0;<em>et&#x00A0;al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref33">33</a>] noted that those with a
        concussion performed significantly slower than controls in choice RT tasks, but not in simple RT
        tasks; however, the motor aspect of this task was limited to pressing a button, and therefore
        complex motor kinematic outcomes cannot be inferred. Consistent with these results, we found
        decreased accuracy in the concussed group across both of our tasks, suggesting that a concussion may
        impart more general ‘noise’ into the motor system. To our knowledge, our task is the only one which
        includes a cue reversal as well as a plane change, requiring two levels of vision and motor
        decoupling, thereby requiring greater recruitment of brain regions within the frontoparietal network
        responsible for arbitrary mapping and attention. Functional imaging studies have also shown a
        correlation between frontoparietal network activation and task performance after a concussion&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref34">34–37</a>].
        Hammeke <em>et al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref37">37</a>] conducted a longitudinal study on National
        Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football players and found that brain regions associated with
        attention decreased in activation during the ‘acute’ stage of injury, however, increased in
        activation during the ‘subacute’ stage, after overt symptoms had resolved. They theorize that during
        this ‘subacute’ period, neurocognitive functions had improved in order to adequately perform on
        standardized clinical concussion tests; however, this improvement likely relied on compensatory
        cognitive mechanisms that resulted in the increased brain activity observed in the ‘subacute’ stage.
        Further, these findings suggest that performance deficits may appear with an increase in task
        difficulty that exceeds the capability of the compensatory activity. Similarly, increased brain
        activity has also been noted within NHL alumni. For example, Esopenko&#x00A0;<em>et&#x00A0;al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref38">38</a>]
        found greater activation of the both the prefrontal and posterior parietal regions during a working
        memory task in those with a history of concussion, despite equivalent behavioral performance when
        compared with nonconcussed participants. Observations of white matter abnormalities reported in
        retired NHL players&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref36">36</a>], adult female athletes&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref39">39</a>]
        and youth athletes&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref40">40</a>] could provide an explanation for observations of
        increased brain activity post-concussion. We postulate that in the present study, where these
        athletes’ brains have ostensibly recovered from mild injury, there may still be deficits in the
        connections between areas required to successfully integrate thought and action&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref24">24–25</a>,
        <a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref41">41–44</a>]. That is, we suggest that our observed
        behavioral deficits may be related to underlying changes in the frontoparietal networks necessary
        for the successful integration of thought and action, and likely these cortical networks’
        interactions with subcortical brain areas, for example, the cerebellum&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref24">24</a>,
        <a href="#ref29">29–30</a>, <a href="#ref41">41–43</a>]. Indeed, we have observed deficits in these
        brain networks related to impaired performance in this same task in another neurologically
        compromised group, those at risk for developing dementia&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref17">17</a>]. Importantly,
        on a practical level, our results suggest that athletes with a history of concussion who are
        slightly slower to react relative to their peers (by ∼10%, in the current study) when simultaneous
        thinking and skilled action is required may be more vulnerable to sustaining a second concussion
        during this ‘subacute’ stage. Further, the results presented here and in our previous research
        suggest that the current return to play assessment – in which thinking and moving are tested
        separately – does not fully capture the functional disability of a concussion. We postulate that the
        use of a complex visuomotor task that requires CMI may be more sensitive to the underlying
        neurological effects of a concussion, and thus may be a useful measure to ensure safe return to
        sport. While the length of time since their previous concussion was not a significant factor in our
        study, this may be due to a low sample size within each “time since concussion” subgroup. Previous
        research in our laboratory, looking at asymptomatic children&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref14">14</a>], did
        find a significant recovery time course. However, further longitudinal investigation on the change
        in CMI performance in concussion and recovery is needed before its use as a measurement to determine
        if an athlete is safe to return to play. Importantly, the current task is simple, quick and
        potentially side-line accessible. Such characteristics are vital since automated devices have
        recently become the new ‘gold standard’ in concussion assessment since they are simple, portable and
        reliable&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref45">45</a>].
    </p>

    <p>
        Interestingly, compared with previous findings in varsity-level young adult, nonelite adolescent,
        and youth athletes&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>], the results presented
        here suggest a reduced effect of concussion on CMI in elite athletes. This difference in performance
        between the elite athletic population and the nonelite athletic populations may be due to a
        protective effect in the elite brain, a superior CMI frontoparietal network, or potentially a
        sampling bias (see below). Some speculate that elite level athletes may simply be protected from the
        effects of a concussion, and thus explains why they are able to compete at the elite level&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref20">20</a>,
        <a href="#ref21">21</a>]. Pellman&#x00A0;<em>et&#x00A0;al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref21">21</a>] found
        that NFL athletes had no neurocognitive deficits within the first week after sustaining a concussion,
        compared with high school athletes who had lingering symptoms. They theorize that this may be due to
        a higher tolerance in these professional athletes to the effects of concussion. Alternatively, we
        suggest that this may, instead, be due to the lack of testing a more complex task, one which pushes
        the movement control system. We propose that elite athletes have a superior frontoparietal network
        that allows for greater compensation following concussion (i.e.,&#x00A0;greater motor control ‘reserve’),
        and thus fewer performance deficits. Studies have shown that elite performers require less neural
        activation in order to correctly execute a skill, which may be an effect of motor learning&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref46">46–48</a>].
        Fitts&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref48">48</a>] theorized that skilled performers tend to follow patterned
        processing of skill acquisition, learned through the ‘Associative Stages of Learning’. He postulated
        that novice athletes must rely on more cognitive processes in order to perform a skill, which is
        attention-demanding and inefficient, whereas experts have a more automatic performance, which is
        rapid, smooth and effortless. Granek&#x00A0;<em>et&#x00A0;al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref49">49</a>], found
        that expert video gamers displayed a reduction in frontoparietal activity, with increased prefrontal
        (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) activity during decoupled (nonstandard) movements compared
        with nongamers during a CMI task in which the actual performance was equal between groups. Both EEG
        and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies have shown that expert, or elite, athletes
        demonstrate ‘neural efficiency’ due to more specific neural circuitry and minimal energy consumption&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref46">46</a>,
        <a href="#ref47">47</a>]. Here we suggest that while behavioral deficits may not be as noticeable in
        the elite athletic population due to these superior networks, the underlying neural effects may
        still be present. Further research involving both complex CMI tasks and imaging are needed to better
        understand the neural effect of mild brain injury on this unique population.

    <p>
        When interpreting the results of this study, it is important to acknowledge that our participants
        were all NHL draft combine invites at the top of their performance level. These athletes likely
        played on the highest skilled teams as children. Relative to novice level teams, elite level teams
        often receive a higher level of medical attention, which may have impacted the care these
        individuals received after sustaining a concussion and ultimately, their recovery&#x00A0;[<a
            href="#ref19">19</a>].
        Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle whether our findings of a potentially increased
        cognitive-motor reserve in elite athletes is an innate characteristic of these individuals or a
        product of their environments and training conditions. Additionally, all concussions were
        self-reported; therefore we cannot be certain that those in our no-history control group had not
        sustained an unreported concussion. However, as mentioned above, these elite level athletes have
        likely received higher levels of medical attention throughout their careers and thus likely had
        better assessment and diagnosis of concussion. Furthermore, we cannot generalize these results to
        other elite level athletes, since there may be sport-related differences (e.g.,&#x00A0;in mechanisms
        of injury), which needs to be further investigated. In addition, while we found no significant
        effects of position, the number of previous concussions sustained, or the length of time since a
        participant’s most recent concussion, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the
        low sample size of some of these subgroups within our main concussion group (see <a href="tab1.xhtml">Table 1</a>
        &amp; <a href="tab2.xhtml">Table 2</a>), and potential inaccuracies due to the fact that many concussions
        likely go unreported. Lastly, while this study did not measure vision or oculomotor control, we
        acknowledge that it may play an important role in our task, specifically for those suffering an
        acute concussion. Our participants were asymptomatic and medically cleared by a physician for vision
        deficits; however, future research should investigate the effects of vision and oculomotor control
        in CMI tasks, especially in those with an acute concussion. Importantly, for this study we were only
        able to assess elite male athletes. Given the increasing awareness of the effect of sex (and the
        completely unstudied effect of gender) on rates of and response to mild head injury&#x00A0;[<a href="#ref50">50–52</a>],
        it will be crucial to repeat this study in elite female athletes in order to adequately address the
        behavioral effects of concussion history on performance. Future work will utilize imaging in order
        to investigate the underlying neurological effects of concussion on CMI and its associated networks.
        Furthermore, a prospective longitudinal study is needed in order to investigate the effects of a
        concussion on CMI over time. Further research on the specificity, sensitivity, and reliability of
        this computer-based CMI task is needed to determine its usefulness as an objective and thorough
        measurement of an athlete’s readiness to return to sport.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Elite level athletes may have lingering neurological deficits after sustaining a concussion, with
            impairment in movement planning during complex (nonstandard) visuomotor tasks and in overall
            accuracy of visually guided reaching movements. Our computer-based CMI task, which requires an
            arbitrary rule association through decoupling vision and action, is able to identify this deficit.
            This worsening in RT during tasks which require simultaneous CMI (an important aspect of sport) may
            leave the athlete more vulnerable to subsequent concussions and their potential long-term effects.
            These results suggest that the current return to play assessments – in which thinking and moving are
            tested separately – do not fully capture the functional disability of a concussion and therefore
            future research focusing on their integration (CMI tasks) is needed.
