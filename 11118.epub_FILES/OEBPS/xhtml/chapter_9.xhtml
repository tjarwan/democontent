</hgroup>
<p class="CO">The epistemological position I have been developing does not privilege truth.<sup><a id="chapter9_1" href="#chapter9-1">1</a></sup> This leaves room for symbols whose contribution to understanding is independent of truth-aptness. Here I argue that understanding is rife with such symbols. Rather than representing, they exemplify. Although I have mentioned exemplification in previous chapters, it needs more explicit treatment. After explicating exemplification, I present case studies to illustrate some of the ways exemplars figure in ethical and mathematical understanding.</p>
<p>Examples are ubiquitous. Philosophers adduce examples to support their theories. Students learn from examples and display their learning by providing examples. Where standards (for, e.g., intonation, proper stance, or poise) are inarticulable, perhaps the only effective way to learn is to take as an example someone who does the thing well. If a student purports to understand a theory&#x2014;be it Darwinism, socialism, consequentialism, or whatever&#x2014;but can provide no examples of how the theory applies, her claim is at least suspect. Why are examples important? A single example is, after all, statistically insignificant. So, it might seem, the ability to provide an example should count for virtually nothing. But often it counts for a lot. The reason, I suggest, is that the example <i>displays</i> an understanding of the topic. It is not just an instance, it is a telling instance.</p>
<p>Earlier I argued that my position is not a pure coherence theory, since tenability requires that a system answer to something outside itself&#x2014;our antecedent commitments about the topic, the methods for finding out about the topic, and the standards for justifying our conclusions about the topic. Nevertheless, my position might seem too close to a coherence theory to be palatable. Plato (1997) maintained that the difference between doxa and episteme is that, unlike doxa, episteme has a tether. The tether I focused on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_184" title="184"/>in <i>Considered Judgment</i> connects the elements of a system to antecedently held epistemic commitments. The community&#x2019;s understanding must be, in a suitable but flexible sense, sustained by what its members were already committed to. This ensures that they are not making up their accounts out of whole cloth, but it may seem to provide no strong reason to think that their conclusions answer to the facts. I continue to consider the tie to antecedent commitments important. But we also need a tether that connects the system to the facts it pertains to. Ever since Plato, epistemologists have assumed that the tether must somehow link the justification for a belief to its truth maker. As Gettier cases show, such a link is elusive. Here I focus on a different tether&#x2014;exemplification. This is the connection between a sample or example and whatever it is a sample or example of. I will argue that it plays a central role in epistemology, accounts for the epistemic functions of models and idealizations, and enables us to appreciate the epistemic contributions of symbols that are not truth apt.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><samp class="SANS-ITC-Stone-Sans-Std-Semibold-11">The Nature of Exemplification</samp></h1>
<p class="TXNI">When an item serves as a sample or example, it exemplifies: it functions as a symbol that makes reference to some of the properties, patterns, or relations it instantiates (Goodman, 1968; Elgin, 1996). In spelling this out, let us take a tolerant approach to properties, recognizing a property corresponding to each extension an item belongs to, regardless of whether that extension is semantically marked or metaphysically privileged.<sup><a id="chapter9_2" href="#chapter9-2">2</a></sup> A property, then, is that which all members of a particular extension share. Patterns and relations receive analogously tolerant treatment. Let us call anything that exemplifies <i>an exemplar</i> and all of an item&#x2019;s properties and all of the patterns and relations it figures in <i>its features</i>.</p>
<p>Such tolerance is metaphysically innocuous. There is no denying that every item belongs to indefinitely many extensions. The members of any given extension have something in common&#x2014;namely, membership in that extension. Some extensions strike us as homogeneous. The members of the class of trombones have in common that they are all trombones. That is a class worth marking out, so we introduce a label for the feature that they share. Other classes seem more motley. There is an extension consisting of the Washington Monument, the atomic number of lead, and my calico cat. Unsurprisingly, we have no label for their common feature. Nevertheless, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_185" title="185"/>my cat shares something with the Washington Monument and the atomic number of lead. Their joint membership in that extension is the feature that they share.</p>
<p>Exemplified features may be static or dynamic, monadic or relational, and may be at any level of generality or abstraction. Because each item has a plethora of features, its capacity to exemplify is broad. It is not boundless, however, for exemplification requires instantiation. Only a bit of Swiss chocolate can be a sample of Swiss chocolate; a bit of Belgian chocolate, however similar in flavor or constitution, is disqualified. Moreover, instantiation alone is not enough. The authentic Swiss chocolate that Jon ate yesterday did not exemplify Swiss chocolate or any other feature. It merely satisfied his sweet tooth. To exemplify, an item must refer to the feature in question, and must do so via its instantiation of that feature.</p>
<p>An exemplar can simultaneously exemplify multiple features. The candy might exemplify being Swiss chocolate, rich in flavor, and an expensive indulgence. But an exemplar cannot simultaneously exemplify all its features. It can point up, make manifest, display, or convey some of its features only by marginalizing, downplaying, bracketing, or overshadowing others. Even if a sample problem in a logic text is the only problem in the book that mentions a dog, it does not (at least under its standard interpretation) exemplify the property of being the only problem that mentions a dog. In a context designed to exemplify a logical form, the problem downplays its being the sole mention of a dog. Exemplification is selective.</p>
<p>Because an item can in principle exemplify any feature it instantiates, the range of features it has the capacity to exemplify is vast and heterogeneous. Remei Capdevila&#x2019;s (2009) discussion of Alighiero Boetti&#x2019;s <i>Rosso Gilera, Rosso Guzzi</i> brings this out:</p>
<p class="Dis-E">Boetti&#x2019;s piece consists of two square, nearly identical panels, one next to the other, whose meager distinction from each other is a slight variation in their red paint, and the raised names and code numbers that identify the different paints, which are inscribed on the panel. Like a color palette, Boetti&#x2019;s piece juxtaposes two different kinds of reds, and in that way it is possible to distinguish between them. In a certain sense, then, the work functions as a paint sample; they exemplify two different synthetic reds, with their commercial codes (60 1232 and 60 1305) and names (&#x201C;Rosso Guzzi&#x201D; and &#x201C;Rosso Gilera&#x201D;). However the work does not only function as a simple color sample, but exemplifies other properties that a chip of paint in a color palette does not exemplify. &#x201C;Rosso Guzzi&#x201D; is the red used to paint Guzzi motorcycles, and &#x201C;Rosso Gilera&#x201D; is the one used for Gilera motorcycles, the two rival Italian motorcycle <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_186" title="186"/>manufacturers. Put side by side, the two panels not only exemplify a slight difference in color but stand for the divide between passionate advocates of each brand. That is to say, since each kind of red possesses the property of being used to paint a specific kind of motorcycle, they can further exemplify the two different brands, and via a chain of reference, the rivalry between the companies. In addition, since the difference in reds is barely noticeable, the piece can further symbolize the negligible distinction that sustains this rivalry. (130&#x2013;131)</p>
<p class="TXNI">She could have gone on in this vein. Building on the exemplification of the rivalry between the two groups of motorcycle aficionados, perhaps the work exemplifies features of rivalry in general, including how, for there to be a genuine rivalry, rivals must be very much alike. Although there is plenty of rivalry between professional baseball teams, and between Little League teams, there is no rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and the Lexington T-Ball Tigers. She might have interpreted the work as exemplifying that, objectively speaking, there is little basis for choice among the rivals. Perhaps it exemplifies that in the end all rivalry is sibling rivalry.</p>
<p>Capdevila continues:</p>
<p class="Dis-E">The illusion of difference is also exemplified by the fact that both paints come from the same manufacturer, as the serial numbers indicate. And the work&#x2019;s symbolization is not exhausted yet. Boetti&#x2019;s piece is made out of synthetic commercial paint intended to lacquer vehicles instead of common fine arts materials, and in that way, the artistic properties of this paint&#x2014;glossiness, brightness, viscosity, or the dripping left when applying it on the panel&#x2014;are exemplified. This can also symbolize the introduction of mass production and consumer goods into the art world. (2009, 130&#x2013;131)</p>
<p class="TXNI">Here she moves to a different domain. That the paint is ordinary commercial paint used to paint vehicles exemplifies an intimate connection between art and commerce, and the vanishing line between the aesthetic and the commercial. It connects art to the market (and not just&#x2014;or even mainly&#x2014;the art market). That features like the brightness, glossiness, and viscosity of vehicular paint are exemplified in a work of art highlights features we might find it worthwhile to attend to when we encounter them in their standard use.</p>
<p>A further interpretation is available, which moves from the economic to the political realm. The paint is not an esoteric substance encountered only in ateliers; it is the sort of stuff you might find in a garage. This exemplifies a democratization of the arts. The material for making art is readily available to pretty much anyone. If the paint on the canvas is mundane <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_187" title="187"/>and readily available, and an interpretation of the work draws on a rivalry between motorcycle aficionados, then art need not be the province of an elite. It is open to all. Evidently a single item can, in the right context, exemplify any and many of its features, enabling the interpreter to forge a variety of epistemically valuable connections across a variety of domains.</p>
<p>Exemplification is not just a device for underscoring salient features or supplying emphasis. It often highlights and affords epistemic access to features that were previously disregarded, even to features that are semantically unmarked. It points up a feature, enabling us to mark out its contours and appreciate its significance. It equips us to recognize that feature when we encounter it in other contexts. Exemplification, then, is not just a vehicle for conveying salience; it is a source of salience. Moreover, the features an exemplar highlights may be difficult to discern. An effective exemplar can marginalize conspicuous features in order to exemplify elusive ones. The most conspicuous feature of a manufacturing process may be its deafening din, while in the context of a safety inspection what the process exemplifies is a barely detectable vulnerability to sabotage. The vulnerability then stands out, while the noise, although still deafening, fades into the cognitive background of things to be ignored.</p>
<p>Being symbols, exemplars require interpretation. In the context of the inspection, does the manufacturing process exemplify vulnerability to sabotage, susceptibility to unscheduled downtime, the prospect of prompting a major insurance claim? The very same security flaw might instantiate all of these. In treating that flaw as an exemplar, the question is: an exemplar of what? Some exemplars belong to regimented systems, where the structure of the system supplies or highly circumscribes the answer. Others are ad hoc. Then interpretation depends on the context within which they function and the way they function in that context.</p>
<p>Even apparently straightforward, highly regimented cases are not so simple as they seem. A customer peering at a commercial paint sample card might seem thereby to know exactly what color Benjamin Moore jonquil yellow paint is. It&#x2019;s the shade on the card. Such cards constitute a regimented system if anything does. Still, knowledgeable consumers recognize that the colors on the sample cards symbolize not an exact shade but a range of colors around the shade appearing on the card. (That is why paint companies recommend that you buy all the paint you will need for a job at once. The paint from different batches that satisfy the recipe for being <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_188" title="188"/>Benjamin Moore jonquil yellow will rarely be visually indistinguishable.) In interpreting the card, consumers need to determine what range of discriminable shades qualifies as jonquil yellow. The cards often provide resources for answering this question as well. Typically a sample card does not just exemplify a single color. Nor does it provide exemplars of an arbitrary collection of colors. Such a card usually consists of a sequence of exemplars of closely related shades. In figuring out the range of the exemplar of jonquil yellow, consumers rightly reason that it includes all the Benjamin Moore yellows that are closer to the exemplar of jonquil yellow than they are to the exemplars of the closest alternatives&#x2014;perhaps goldenrod, sunflower, and saffron. Although some vagueness remains, relevant contrasts help to fix the reference of an exemplar.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, folks do not wander into paint stores out of idle curiosity about available paint colors; they want to choose paint for a job&#x2014;maybe to paint the house. So they need to project from the sample to a larger extension it represents. Let us say that a sample that exemplifies a particular feature <i>typifies</i> the extension comprised of all and only things that instantiate that feature. Such items <i>match</i> the exemplar. The paint sample then typifies all and only those things whose color falls within the range of Benjamin Moore jonquil yellow. By exemplifying a feature&#x2014;by highlighting or displaying that feature&#x2014;an exemplar affords epistemic access to it. Someone who properly interprets the exemplar is in a position to recognize the feature in question.</p>
<p>Because paint samples belong to regimented systems, knowledgeable consumers have little difficulty determining what features they exemplify and what extensions they typify. But not all exemplars are so readily interpreted, for not all exemplars belong to regimented systems. One of the powers of exemplification as a referential device is that we can improvise exemplars at will. Simply adducing something as an example typically makes it one. Cycling to work can exemplify concern for the environment; a can of gourmet cat food can exemplify the propensity to unduly pamper pets; a slipshod student paper can exemplify indifference to the course, and so forth. Treating something as an example normally makes it one.</p>
<p>Interpretation can be tricky, particularly in the absence of a regimented system. An ornithologist identifies a bird as an example of a junco. He may do nothing more than point to it, expecting his audience to figure out what extension it typifies&#x2014;that is, what other birds are juncos. Or he may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_189" title="189"/>underscore its size, coloration, markings, and the shape of its beak. Had he ignored the bird, it still would have had all these features; but it would not have symbolized them. By pointing it out, he exploits features the bird had anyway, bringing the bird to exemplify them. Perhaps he tells his audience which features to fixate on; perhaps not. If all goes well, they can now recognize a junco when they see one. But despite his tutelage, they may be uncertain how to interpret the exemplar. How closely do other birds have to match the exemplar to belong to the typified extension? Do the eye markings matter? Does the plumage vary with season or age? Do juncos exhibit sexual dimorphism? To complicate matters further, the same item can exemplify different features in different contexts. A free sample of laundry detergent that exemplifies its cleaning power in a marketing campaign exemplifies banality in an assessment of that campaign. A bird that exemplifies being a junco in one context exemplifies being a nonmigratory bird in another.</p>
<p>When exemplars are products of improvisation, interpreters have no regimented system to rely on. They draw on context, background assumptions, and, where available, collateral information instead. In communicative settings like the one above, their interpretive stance is Gricean (see Grice, 1989). They assume that the cooperative principle is in effect, hence that they have the resources needed to interpret the exemplar correctly. If so, the feature exemplified is relevant to the communicative exchange; it is capable of becoming salient to the audience via that exchange, and its being made salient will promote the objectives of the exchange, or will be sufficiently important to justify abruptly changing the subject.</p>
<p>In investigative settings, interpretation relies on an analogue of the cooperative principle that involves confidence in the study&#x2019;s design. In effect, interpreters assume that nature is cooperative. Assuming the study is well designed, the result&#x2014;whatever it turns out to be&#x2014;will exemplify something informative, accurate, unambiguous, and relevant. Needless to say, such confidence can be misplaced. Some results exemplify not hitherto unknown features of the phenomena, but inadequacies in the study&#x2019;s design. Results that were expected to fall within a given range fall outside it, or they are ambiguous, or they fail to achieve statistical significance. This is disappointing. But it should be no surprise that the assumptions that guide interpretation are sometimes unfounded. Exemplars are not always effective or properly interpreted, but when they are effective and properly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_190" title="190"/>interpreted, the reasons are similar to those that explain the effectiveness and proper interpretation of other symbolic exchanges.</p>
<p>Focus on pedagogical and commercial samples may suggest that exemplification is a conduit for what is already known or understood, rather than a source of knowledge or understanding. This is incorrect. A mining inspector extracts air samples from a mineshaft to find out something no one yet knows about the distribution of gases in the mine. If the samples are properly taken, he has reason to believe that the gases his samples exemplify are typical of the gases in the mine. A pollster questions potential voters about their attitudes toward immigration. If the sample is suitably chosen and the questions well framed, she acquires new information about public opinion on the topic. There are, of course, no guarantees. Both cases involve projection from a limited sample. It is a brute fact of inductive life that even well-chosen, well-taken samples are sometimes misleading. But if the samples are well taken and the background theory is well founded, there is epistemically good reason to project to a wider class of cases.</p>
<p>An appreciation of the feature and its instantiations can be woven into our developing understanding, stabilizing or enhancing its equilibrium. Alternatively, an exemplar may threaten equilibrium, making manifest that things are more problematic than we previously thought. Either way, there is an epistemic gain. A well-chosen sample or example can either strengthen an account or disclose an unanticipated weakness.</p>
<p>Given what I&#x2019;ve said, accurate projection might seem assured. The sampler need only project to the extension the sample typifies. The problem is to figure out which extension that is. The mine inspector&#x2019;s air sample typifies all the air in the mine that shares the chemical features exemplified by the sample. That&#x2019;s trivial and unhelpful. The critical question is which air is that? Is it the air throughout the mine? Or is it the air at a given level in the mine? Or is it the air where the mine crosses a particular seam of ore? Or is the sample a statistical fluke, exemplifying features it alone possesses? These are standard and often hard questions about how to characterize evidence in order to make valid projections from it.</p>
<p>One might wonder whether the air sample or the poll&#x2019;s results are evidence at all. A plausible criterion of evidence is that evidence pertaining to <i>p</i> consists of whatever bears on whether <i>p</i> is the case. If so, epistemically inaccessible items qualify as evidence. So do items no one has any reason to consider evidence. Suppose 83 percent of the cases of absolute pitch have a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_191" title="191"/>genetic basis. No one knows what the genetic basis is or even suspects that there is a gene for absolute pitch. Obviously, genetic screening would be useless in attempting early identification of children with absolute pitch, since investigators would not know what to look for. Still, on the above criterion, the presence of the gene would qualify as evidence. Although such unknown factors bear on whether <i>p</i>, they are epistemically inert. They provide no reason to believe, accept, or even suspect that <i>p.</i> We might conclude that this discredits the criterion. Alternatively, we might distinguish between <i>being evidence</i> and <i>functioning as evidence.</i> Then we can concede that the gene was evidence all along, even though there was no feasible way to access that evidence. Not much hangs on the choice between these alternatives. Either some items that are in fact evidence do not function as such, or to qualify as evidence, an item must, in the epistemic circumstances, be capable of functioning as such. The critical point is that for something to function as evidence for <i>p</i>, it should provide a reason to believe, accept, or at least suspect that <i>p.</i> For something to function as evidence against <i>p,</i> it should provide a reason to disbelieve, reject, or doubt that <i>p.</i> This, I suggest, requires that to function as evidence, an item must exemplify its connection to the hypothesis it bears on. Once investigators know enough about DNA, a strand of hair found at the crime scene can function as evidence linking the suspect to the crime. The hair exemplifies a genetic pattern instantiated by the subject and few, if any, others.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><samp class="SANS-ITC-Stone-Sans-Std-Semibold-11">Making an Example Of</samp></h1>
<p class="TXNI">Goodman (1968) maintains that anything that instantiates a feature can exemplify it. In principle this may be so, but in practice things are not so simple. For not all instances of a feature can constitute <i>good</i> or <i>effective</i> exemplars. A feature may be camouflaged: a tiger who blends into the surrounding jungle instantiates being striped, but would in that circumstance be unlikely to exemplify stripedness. (It might, however, exemplify how stripes&#x2014;even orange stripes&#x2014;can camouflage in a jungle of green.) A feature may be occluded: a bald man wearing a hat is ill positioned to exemplify his baldness. A feature may be overshadowed: the fearsome timbre of a lion&#x2019;s roar may block its effectively exemplifying its pitch. An instance may be a borderline case. Even though a chartreuse fire hydrant is a vivid instance of greenness, its color is too close to yellow to be a good exemplar <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_192" title="192"/>of greenness. An interpreter would likely take it to typify the members of a class consisting of some greens and some yellows rather than all of the greens and none of the yellows. It would not be a good tool for teaching a young child colors.<sup><a id="chapter9_3" href="#chapter9-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>What converts an instance into an exemplar? Sometimes conversion requires no more than pointing. What is a junco? That&#x2019;s one! So long as it is clear that we are concerned to identify a normal member of a species, no more may be required. Sometimes we need to exclude distractors. The roof of a crocodile&#x2019;s mouth is a distinctive shade of coral; but a paint company would be ill advised to recommend that potential customers peer into a crocodile&#x2019;s mouth to see that color. Crocodiles are so rare and so dangerous that any glimpse of the roof of one&#x2019;s mouth is unlikely to make the color manifest. We could not see it long enough or well enough, and would be unlikely to attend to it carefully enough (or, if we did, to survive long enough) to decide whether it is the color we want to paint the den. It is far better to create a lasting, readily available, easily interpretable sample of the color&#x2014;one whose function is precisely to make the color manifest. Such a sample should be stable, accessible, and have no properties that distract attention from the color.</p>
<p>Considerable stage setting is often required to generate an effective exemplar. Since shape is always accompanied by color (Plato, 1997), we cannot hope to provide a completely colorless exemplar of a dodecagon. We might, however, tell our interlocutors to ignore the color and focus on the shape of our exemplar. Or we might provide several, differently colored dodecagons, and induce them to focus on the salient common property. Either way, we set the stage to orient the audience to the feature of interest. In yet other cases, we need to tamper with the substance being sampled. An experiment designed to discover whether water is compressible would not use ordinary rainwater or tap water. Such liquids contain impurities. Were we to effect compression of such a liquid, we would not be able to tell whether the water or the impurities accounted for the solution&#x2019;s compressibility. Rather, the experiment would begin with distilled water&#x2014;water from which, as far as we can tell, all impurities have been removed.</p>
<p>Before we can remove irrelevant factors, we need to do some analysis: we need to conceptualize the item in question as comprised of components&#x2014;those we seek to exemplify, and those we do well to set aside. Analysis is often straightforward. Our prior understanding of the domain frequently <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_193" title="193"/>enables us to identify the relevant factors. Rainwater = H<sub>2</sub>O + impurities. But things are not always so simple. For a different experiment we might want to distinguish between the components of rainwater that are due to pollution and those that are not. In that case, pollen would be a component of rainwater rather than an impurity. In yet other cases we might take rainwater to consist of whatever liquid falls from the sky. Then even sulfuric acid would be a component of rainwater. As our interests and purposes change, we may need to reconceptualize the phenomena to devise an effective exemplar.</p>
<p>The proper way to analyze depends on what we are trying to do. Linguists factor verbal behavior into competence and performance. Competence is stable; performance fluctuates. Given this factorization, they can investigate a variety of verbal phenomena effectively. They can, for example, bracket performance errors to exemplify features that remain invariant across language use. Or they can bracket underlying competence to identify patterns of performance errors common in a given speech community or at a given stage of linguistic development. In assessing fluency, however, they might consider the competence&#x2013;performance distinction idle. They might do better to partition the domain so as to exemplify the frequency and distribution of surface errors, being indifferent to underlying linguistic structures.</p>
<p>Differentiating between signal and noise is commonplace. It is a matter of distilling meaningful information out of the total available information on a topic. But what is signal in one context is noise in another. Ordinarily, a questioner wants to know the answer to her question, and a teacher wants to know whether her student knows the answer. In these cases, the content of the answer is the signal. How quickly the respondent replies counts as noise. But psychologists often focus on reaction times. For their purposes, it doesn&#x2019;t matter what the respondent answers. The content of her answer is noise. The signal is how long it takes her to answer. To distinguish between signal and noise requires a criterion for what makes information meaningful. The criterion is keyed to the question at hand. If the question is a new one, inquirers may need to reconceptualize the phenomena or repartition the domain to devise an appropriate criterion.</p>
<p>Such reconceptualization can highlight features that obtain but are obscured under more standard characterizations. Rather than calling an enclosed curve an ellipse, it might be fruitful to consider it a perturbed circle. The curve is an ellipse, just as the raindrop contains both sulfuric acid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_194" title="194"/>and pollen, and Boetti&#x2019;s painting contains two rectangles. But the items admit of other descriptions that may, in a given context, be more illuminating. The critical question is what features of the item we want to be in a position to focus on. Since exemplification is selective, to treat an item as an exemplar is to selectively disregard some of its features.</p>
<p>The novice who emulates the performance of an expert treats that expert as an exemplar. She identifies the features of his behavior that she thinks account for his success. That is, she factors his complex behavior into elements, selectively disregards those she considers irrelevant to his effectiveness, and sets herself to reproduce the rest. It is neither necessary nor possible to reproduce his performance in its entirety. Some of the features of that performance are irreproducible&#x2014;the fact that it was done on Tuesday the fifth of June, or done by someone born in Detroit, for example. Others are simply irrelevant. There is no reason to think that someone&#x2019;s tennis game would improve were she to change the color of her bedroom curtains or to reorganize her library to match his. Yet others are at the wrong grain. Possibly revising how far she stands from the baseline would make some difference to her serve, and it would not be surprising if copying the expert in this respect is a good idea. But it is probably not beneficial to insist on emulating his position to the nearest millimeter. Instead of attempting to slavishly reproduce everything she discerns, she interprets the expert&#x2019;s behavior as exemplifying the features she takes to constitute, underwrite, or contribute to his excellence. If she is successful in identifying and reproducing enough of the features that figure in his success, her performance is apt to improve.</p>
<p>Berkeley&#x2019;s criticism of Locke&#x2019;s discussion of abstract general ideas brings out the power of selectivity. According to Locke, &#x201C;The general idea of a triangle <span class="ellipsis">&#x2026;</span> must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalene, but <i>all and none</i> of these at once&#x201D; (Locke, 1984, Book IV, ch. 7, sect. 9, quoted in Berkeley, 1957, &#xA7;13). Berkeley balks. He can, he insists, frame no such idea. Nor does he think that anyone else can. The definition of the abstract triangle is, as Locke admits, inconsistent. How are we supposed to frame an idea of such a thing? How can it figure in proofs? But if we cannot frame such an idea, how is it possible to prove theorems that hold of triangles in general? Berkeley&#x2019;s answer is this:</p>
<p class="Dis-E">Though the idea I have in view whilst I make the demonstration be, for instance, that of an isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a determinate length, I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_195" title="195"/>may nevertheless be certain that [my proof] extends to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or bigness soever. And that is because neither the right angle, nor the equality, nor the determinate length of the sides are at all concerned in the demonstration. It is true the diagram I have in view includes all these particulars, but then there is not the least mention made of them in the proof of the proposition. It is not said the three angles are equal to two right ones, because one of them is a right angle, or because the sides comprehending it are the same length. Which sufficiently shows that the right angle might have been oblique, and the sides unequal, and for all that the demonstration would have held good. (Berkeley, 1957, &#xA7;16)</p>
<p class="TXNI">By selectively disregarding the rightness of the angle, the equality of the sides, and the exact length of the sides, Berkeley brings the particular triangle he is working with to exemplify features it shares with all other Euclidean triangles. It affords epistemic access to geometrical features of Euclidean triangles in general.</p>
<p>One might think that exemplification is not necessary to achieve this goal: it suffices that the precise measures of the sides and the angles are ignored. This is not so. The isosceles right triangle is <i>capable</i> of symbolizing generally because these particulars can be selectively disregarded. But to be capable of symbolizing generally is not enough. A picture of my cat does not become a picture of cats in general merely because in discussing it I omit mention of the distinctive color of her eyes and the markings on her fur. Rather, Berkeley insists, &#x201C;An idea which, considered by itself, is particular, becomes general <i>by being made to represent or stand for</i> all other particular ideas of the same sort&#x201D; (Berkeley, 1957, &#xA7;12, italics mine). The mode of representation is exemplification. The isosceles triangle in his proof not only <i>is</i> an enclosed three sided figure on a Euclidean plane; his proof is an effective general proof because <i>the triangle refers to its being such a figure</i>. By so doing, it stands for other such figures, and discloses properties they share.</p>
<p>Exemplars need not be propositional. Boetti&#x2019;s painting and Berkeley&#x2019;s triangle, as well as the multitude of samples and examples we encounter every day, lack truth-values. Still, it is worth emphasizing that the mode of symbolization can be crucial to the exemplification of a particular feature, and that propositional modes do not always have the edge. In 1854, a cholera epidemic broke out in a London neighborhood. John Snow, now recognized as one of the fathers of epidemiology, traced the epidemic to its source by plotting cholera deaths on a city map that included the locations of water pumps and major buildings. His plot demonstrated that the deaths <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_196" title="196"/>were centered around the Broad Street pump. To be sure, the denizens of the neighborhood shared more than a water pump. They breathed the same air, bought food at the same markets, were likely bitten by the same fleas, and so forth. So the proximity of the pump would hardly seem to favor the hypothesis that cholera is water borne. Snow&#x2019;s map displayed the significance of the pump, because it also disclosed that people associated with two local institutions did not contract cholera. Workers in the local brewery, who drank beer rather than water, were unaffected; so were denizens of the nearby workhouse, who drew water from a different pump. The two institutions supplied a natural control for testing the hypothesis that water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the epidemic (Tufte, 1997). Snow&#x2019;s map exemplifies the connection between the cholera deaths and the pump. It shows that the pump is at the center of the epidemic. A comprehensive list of the addresses of the victims, the locations of London water pumps, breweries, and workhouses, and the admission that brewery workers prefer to drink beer would not have made anything like so clear a case, for it would not have made the proximity to the pump perspicuous.</p>

<p class="TXNI">What I&#x2019;ve said so far has perhaps made it plausible that exemplification is epistemically important. It highlights features we might otherwise overlook. This might seem to be merely a matter of directing attention. But exemplification plays a far more central role in understanding. Let&#x2019;s look at some cases.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS-ITC-Stone-Sans-Std-Semibold-11">Ethics</samp></h2>
<p class="TXNI">Suppose our goal is to understand the wrongness of lying. This might mean a variety of things. We might want to understand <i>why</i> lying is wrong, or <i>what makes</i> lying wrong, or <i>when</i> or <i>to what extent</i> lying is wrong. These are all legitimate questions. But I am after bigger game. I want to understand how lying&#x2019;s being wrong fits into the fabric of human life. Satisfactory answers to each of the foregoing questions will supply part of the answer but, I suggest, only part. Although it is widely agreed that lying is generally wrong, there is considerable controversy about why. Kantians locate the wrongness of lying in its being a violation of the categorical imperative; consequentialists, in the undesirability of the outcomes that result. Perfectionists focus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_197" title="197"/>on the defective moral character of the liar; rights theorists, on the violation of the hearer&#x2019;s rights to truthful information. And so forth.</p>
<p>Some philosophers, such as Strevens (2010), maintain that to understand the wrongness of lying is to derive a proposition such as &#x2018;Lying is generally wrong&#x2019; from the true moral law that grounds it. Each of the positions I&#x2019;ve listed, we may assume, can provide a suitable derivation from its chosen basis. None has achieved consensus that <i>its</i> basis is <i>the real basis</i>. This is not by itself problematic. It could just be evidence that ethics is hard. I have a different worry in mind. It is that any such derivation&#x2014;even the one grounded in the real basis, if there is such a thing&#x2014;is incomplete. It omits important aspects that other theories supply. To see it, suppose we concede that, say, Kantians are right. What grounds the wrongness of lying is that lying typically violates the categorical imperative. Nevertheless, it remains true and not unimportant that liars are morally defective; that lies tend to produce a preponderance of undesirable consequences; that lies violate people&#x2019;s rights; and so forth. Even if these truths cannot be derived from the categorical imperative, if we want to understand the wrongness of lying, they ought not be overlooked.</p>
<p>I suggest that to understand the wrongness of lying is to appreciate how lying&#x2019;s generally being wrong permeates human relationships, practices, and institutions. This involves more than just recognizing how it fits into the moral order. Other aspects of lying&#x2019;s wrongness stem from the cognitive, emotional, social, and economic costs of lying and being lied to, as well as the costs of designing and implementing safeguards to protect against lies. Our understanding might incorporate an appreciation of the mechanisms to secure the bases of trust among colleagues and strangers, and/or mechanisms to limit the consequences of trust&#x2019;s being betrayed, and so forth. It might be sensitive to the ways lying fosters distrust, undermining the credibility of even those who tell the truth. It might even recognize how the wrongness of lying figures in the natural order&#x2014;for example, in the evolution of language and of creatures capable of using language. To understand the wrongness of lying, of course, we also need to appreciate how and when lying is morally permissible, and how and when, permissible or not, it is advantageous. The issue is extraordinarily complex. An understanding of it ramifies in numerous, sometimes surprising directions.</p>
<p>Each of the moral laws, and each of the social, institutional, and biological accounts I&#x2019;ve mentioned, captures something significant about the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_198" title="198"/>wrongness of lying. Even if, as Kantians maintain, the reason why lying is wrong is independent of the positive or negative consequences of telling lies, it is hard to deny that lying often has bad consequences. The same holds for its figuring in a morally defective character. It is hard to deny that these features matter. If we want to understand the wrongness of lying, we should not lose track of such points. So an account of understanding that stops with grounding relations is inadequate. To understand the wrongness of lying evidently involves appreciating the myriad ways lying&#x2019;s being wrong infiltrates multiple, disparate domains. Even if some of the factors I mention are only peripherally related to whatever it is that <i>makes</i> lying wrong, we should not cavalierly dismiss them. A comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon would do well to accommodate such peripheral features.</p>
<p>I have cast a very wide net, and claimed that the phenomenon of interest extends across and, no doubt, well beyond its reach. Maybe moral wrongness resides at the center of the net, but prudential and epistemological tendrils extend outward. How can we hope to grasp it? As I&#x2019;ve described it, the problem is what William James (1983, 448) called a &#x2018;blooming, buzzing confusion&#x2019;, with no obvious way to corral it. I&#x2019;ve mentioned a bunch of disparate facts, each of which bears some connection to our topic, many of them mediated by controversial&#x2014;or at least controverted&#x2014;theories. It might seem that the effort to understand the wrongness of lying is hopelessly demanding.</p>
<p>Rather, I suggest that each of the plausible moral accounts of what makes lying wrong, and each of the plausible social, economic, and biological accounts, affords some insight into the issue by exemplifying a different way in which lying is deleterious. Kantianism exemplifies the failure of respect inherent in lying; consequentialism exemplifies the largely negative consequences; perfectionism exemplifies the defectiveness of the liar&#x2019;s moral character; and so forth. Each highlights features that the others obscure. The several accounts of what makes lying wrong are incompatible. They cannot all be true. But each plausible account is true enough to be capable of exemplifying an important feature of lying&#x2019;s deleteriousness. To focus on only one account&#x2014;even if it is the true and ultimate account of morality&#x2014;would leave us with an impoverished understanding of the wrongness of lying.</p>
<p>It does not follow that anything anyone might say or think about the wrongness of lying has some place in my capacious account. Because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_199" title="199"/>truthfulness is so central to human interactions, there is a lot that an understanding of the wrongness of lying might incorporate. But there is plenty that it rightly excludes. The Pinocchio-inspired contention that lying&#x2019;s wrongness engenders unattractive nose elongation has no place in an understanding of the topic. I suggest that any account that exemplifies deleterious features or consequences of lying is apt to exhibit some understanding of the topic. So do accounts that show why lying is sometimes advantageous or even admirable. But accounts that allege that lying has features it does not have, or that features of lying are deleterious (or, indeed, advantageous) when they are not, embody a misunderstanding of the topic.<sup><a id="chapter9_4" href="#chapter9-4">4</a></sup> They purport to exemplify features that lying does not in fact instantiate or features that lying instantiates but are irrelevant to lying&#x2019;s being wrong.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><samp class="SANS-ITC-Stone-Sans-Std-Semibold-11">Mathematics</samp></h1>
<p class="TXNI">One might think that the plausibility of my claim derives from the lack of consensus about the ground of lying&#x2019;s wrongness. Perhaps the epistemic value of diverse exemplars stems from the sorry state of ethics. I disagree. A similar pattern obtains in mathematics, a field characterized by overwhelming consensus. Mathematical theorems are proved and valid proofs are considered beyond dispute so long as the axioms and rules remain in effect. But what exactly is the function of proof?</p>
<p>Fermat&#x2019;s last theorem is: For <i>n</i> &gt; 2, <i>x</i><span class="ePub-SUP-I">n</span> + <i>y</i><span class="ePub-SUP-I">n</span> &#x2260; <i>z</i><span class="ePub-SUP-I">n</span>. It is true. By 1990, it had been tested computationally for values of <i>n</i> through many millions. By then, probably no one who considered the matter worried that it was false. Still, mathematicians weren&#x2019;t satisfied. They demanded proof. Evidence, even overwhelming evidence, wasn&#x2019;t good enough. Why not? One seemingly plausible answer is they want a right to be sure. But doesn&#x2019;t all that evidence confer a right to be sure? By 1990 there was far more evidence of the truth of Fermat&#x2019;s last theorem than there is for almost any empirical contention we count as knowledge. No one denied that. Still, in mathematical circles, Andrew Wiles&#x2019;s proof of the theorem was a cause for celebration. This suggests that the proof of a theorem is doing something other than supplying sufficient reason to think that the theorem is true. What might that be?</p>
<p>One possibility is that what is wanted is not just sufficient reason to think that the theorem is true, it is sufficient reason to think that it is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_200" title="200"/><i>necessarily true</i>. Empirical evidence, or the quasi-empirical evidence that testing cases computationally supplies, is evidence of truth, but not of necessary truth. The problem with this proposal is that Fermat&#x2019;s last theorem is a mathematical claim. We already know that if it is true, it is necessarily true. There&#x2019;s no chance that although true, it&#x2019;s just a coincidence that it turns out to be true, or that, although true in this world, there are other possible worlds in which it is false. The goal of proof, it seems, is neither to engender a nonfortuitously justified belief that a mathematical proposition is true nor to engender a nonfortuitously justified belief that it is necessarily true. Something else seems to be going on.</p>
<p>There are additional reasons to buttress this suspicion. We value proofs of what might be called Moorean mathematical claims, such as 2 + 3 = 5. They are, like Moore&#x2019;s commonsensical claims, contentions we are completely convinced of independently of proof (see Moore, 1993). Indeed, it is overwhelmingly likely that if we had a putative proof that such a claim was false, we would reject the proof and the proof procedure that generated it rather than reevaluate the claim. Still, it is lovely to see how such a claim follows from the Peano axioms.</p>
<p>I suggest that the function of proof is not mainly to afford reason to believe that a theorem is true or that it is necessarily true. It is to exemplify a series of mathematical relations that show it to be true. Demonstration is exemplification. The function of a proof is to make the necessary truth of a particular mathematical proposition manifest&#x2014;that is, to exemplify its necessary truth and to exemplify relations between its truth and other mathematical truths.</p>
<p>To see this, consider Pythagoras&#x2019;s proof of the irrationality of <img class="inline1" height="16" src="../images/002.png" alt="image"/>. (This is a very simple, lucid, and justly famous proof. I include obvious steps, and explications in order to make my point clear.)<sup><a id="chapter9_5" href="#chapter9-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The background:</p>
<ol class="List-1">
<li class="L-Ef">A <i>rational number</i> is a ratio, <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are integers.</li>
<li class="L-Em">Odd numbers always have odd squares. (This has been previously proven.)</li>
<li class="L-El">Common factors cancel out, so every fraction is equivalent to a fully reduced fraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>The proof:</p>
<ol class="List-1">
<li class="L-Ef" value="4">Let <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> be a fully reduced fraction. (This begs no question since common factors cancel out.)</li>
<li class="L-Em">If <img class="inline1" height="16" src="../images/002.png" alt="image"/> is irrational, 2 &#x2260; (<i>a</i>/<i>b</i>)<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li class="L-Em"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_201" title="201"/>2 &#x2260; (<i>a</i>/<i>b</i>)<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> &#x2260; 2<i>b</i><sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li class="L-Em">Assume for reductio: <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>b</i><sup>2</sup>. (That is, assume that <img class="inline1" height="16" src="../images/002.png" alt="image"/> is rational.)</li>
<li class="L-Em">Then <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> is even (since it is equal to 2<i>b</i><sup>2</sup>).</li>
<li class="L-Em">Therefore <i>a</i> is even (since the square of an odd number is always odd).</li>
<li class="L-Em">Since <i>a</i> is even, <i>a</i> = 2<i>c</i> (where <i>c</i> is some integer).</li>
<li class="L-Em">Therefore 2<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> = (2<i>c</i>)<sup>2</sup> = 4<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> (from 5 and 8 and ((2)<sup>2</sup> = 4)).</li>
<li class="L-Em">Therefore <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> (by dropping <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> = (2<i>c</i>)<sup>2</sup> and dividing by 2).</li>
<li class="L-Em">Therefore <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is even (since it is equal to 2<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>).</li>
<li class="L-Em">Therefore <i>b</i> is even (since the square of an odd number is always odd).</li>
<li class="L-Em">But if both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are even, then they have 2 as a common factor.</li>
<li class="L-El">Therefore <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is not a fully reduced fraction, which contradicts the hypothesis.</li>
</ol>
<p class="TXNI">QED.</p>
<p>The proof consists of a chain of exemplars, each highlighting a feature that would have to obtain if <img class="inline1" height="16" src="../images/002.png" alt="image"/> were rational. Some (like the fact that the square of an odd number is always odd), are drawn from previously proven background information. Others are products of earlier steps in the proof. Many are equations. <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>, 2<i>b</i><sup>2</sup>, (2<i>c</i>)<sup>2</sup>, and 4<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> are mathematically equivalent. In Fregean terms, they differ only in their mode of presentation. Despite their equivalence, the choice among them is not arbitrary. The modes of presentation matter, for the expressions exemplify different features of their ostensible referent. For example, that <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> makes it manifest that <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> must be even. And in light of the fact that only odd numbers have odd squares, this makes it manifest that <i>b</i> must be even. Had another equivalent expression, such as <img class="inline" width="130" src="../images/008.png" alt="image"/>, replaced 2<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> in step 10, <i>b</i>&#x2019;s evenness would have been obscured. Because the proof must make <i>b</i>&#x2019;s evenness manifest, such a substitution would be unacceptable. At different points in the proof, different features need to be exemplified. The proof proceeds by a series of transformations, each step exemplifying something that had been instantiated but not exemplified previously. By highlighting consequences implicit in the assumption that <img class="inline1" height="16" src="../images/002.png" alt="image"/> is rational, proof as a whole thereby exemplifies the impossibility of <img class="inline1" height="16" src="../images/002.png" alt="image"/> being rational.</p>
<p>The mode of representation a proof uses to characterize the items it draws on is critical. For a sequence of mathematical propositions to constitute a proof, the mathematical entity or operation must be represented in a way that exemplifies the features that make manifest the connection between the premises, axioms, lemmas, and definitions and further elements in the chain, and ultimately to the conclusion.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_202" title="202"/>Mathematics values multiple proofs of the same theorem. If truth were the only issue, one valid proof would suffice. Possibly a second proof would give a modicum of corroboration; but beyond that, further proofs would be otiose. Gauss devised eight proofs of quadratic reciprocity. A vast number of additional proofs have been developed since. Why go to all that trouble? Surely not because after the first few proofs mathematicians were still harboring doubts about the theorem&#x2019;s truth! Fans of grounding maintain that the only proof whose apprehension constitutes an understanding is the proof from the <i>real</i> metaphysically basic axioms (see Strevens, 2010). Neither position is plausible. Nor is either consonant with mathematical practice. Rather, I suggest, the reason multiple proofs of the same theorem are valuable is that they exemplify different mathematical relations.</p>
<p>There are numerous proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagoras&#x2019;s proof relies on the properties of squares; Bashkara&#x2019;s proof, on properties of right triangles; Garfield&#x2019;s proof, on properties of trapezoids. Each contributes to our understanding of geometry by showing how geometric truths about different shapes interweave. Recently, Zimba (2002) devised a trigonometric proof of the theorem. This was something mathematicians thought could not be done. They believed that since sin<sup>2</sup><i>a</i> + cos<sup>2</sup><i>a</i> = 1 presupposes the Pythagorean theorem, any trigonometric proof of the theorem would be circular. But Zimba&#x2019;s proof by subtraction does not rely on sin<sup>2</sup><i>a</i> + cos<sup>2</sup><i>a</i> = 1. So the role of the Pythagorean theorem in the proof of sin<sup>2</sup><i>a</i> + cos<sup>2</sup><i>a</i> = 1 is irrelevant. Zimba&#x2019;s proof thus exemplifies that the relation between Euclidean geometry and trigonometry is more complicated and less stratified than was previously supposed. We increase our understanding of the theorem by seeing how it figures in different mathematical domains, how it follows from and leads to different theorems. Our understanding of the warp and woof of the fabric of mathematics is enhanced by each of the multiple proofs. Just as different features of the moral realm are exemplified by different accounts of the wrongness of lying, different features of the mathematical domain are exemplified by different proofs of the theorem.</p>
<p>Exemplification&#x2019;s role in mathematics extends beyond its function in proofs. It enables us to appreciate a major advantage that the Arabic numeral system has over the Roman numerals. We are taught in school that one of the limitations of Roman numerals is that the notation did not have a numeral for 0. This sensitized us to the bewilderment that would emerge should someone attempt to subtract V from V. But 0 plays another important role <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_203" title="203"/>in Arabic numerical notation. It serves as a place holder. Roman numerals had no need of such a place holder. Other early notations just used spaces between numerals. This makes it difficult to discern the difference between, say, 1 14 and 1 14. So 0 as a placeholder is an enormous convenience (see Mazur, 2014). All of this is true. But there is another, conceptually deeper benefit. With Roman numerals, you can count only so far before you have to introduce another letter&#x2014;C or M or whatever. This prompts the question: what happens to the numbers when the alphabet is exhausted? The system of Roman numerals supplies no clue. The Arabic system, having the capacity to use 0 as a placeholder, exemplifies the unboundedness of the integers. They are never exhausted; you can just keep counting.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><samp class="SANS-ITC-Stone-Sans-Std-Semibold-11">Conclusion</samp></h1>
<p class="TXNI">In this chapter I&#x2019;ve argued that exemplification is an important vehicle for epistemic access. It acquaints epistemic agents with features of things they had been unaware of or whose significance escaped their notice. Exemplars such as textbook examples and commercial samples are conduits for the transfer of understanding or knowledge. But exemplification also figures as a source of understanding. Different approaches to a problem can highlight different aspects of it. The proof of a theorem exemplifies, and enables epistemic agents to understand, mathematical relations that were latent in the axioms. Multiple exemplars exemplify different aspects of the same phenomenon, enabling epistemic agents to appreciate how that phenomenon figures in the greater scheme of things.</p>
