<h2 class="h2" id="foreword"><a id="page_v"/>Foreword</h2>
<p class="noindent">Now in its 14th edition, the <em>Doing Business</em> report demonstrates the power of a simple idea: measure and report the actual effect of a government policy.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In the summer of 1983, a group of researchers working with Hernando de Soto got all the permits required to open a small garment business on the outskirts of Lima, Peru. Their goal was to measure how long this took. I read de Soto&#8217;s book, <em>The Other Path</em>, decades ago, but I was so astonished by the answer it reported that I remember it today: 289 days.</p>
<p class="noindentt">De Soto&#8217;s conjecture, which turned out to be right, was that measuring and reporting would create pressure for improvements in the efficiency of government. In the foreword to the revised edition of his book that he wrote in 2002, de Soto reports that because of changes to regulations and procedures, the same business could get all the required permits in a single day.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a letter published in the Winter 2006 issue of the <em>Journal of Economic Perspectives</em>, Simeon Djankov describes how de Soto&#8217;s idea grew into this report. When Joseph Stiglitz was the World Bank Chief Economist, he selected the topic and picked the team for <em>The World Development Report 2002: Building Institutions for Markets</em>. Djankov, who was a member of this team, reached out to Andrei Shleifer, a professor at Harvard, who had done research on the effects that different legal systems had on market development. Shleifer and co-authors agreed to work on some background papers for the <em>World Development Report</em> that would examine new data on such processes as getting the permits to start a new business that could be compared across countries. In 2003, this data collection effort yielded the first <em>Doing Business</em> report, which presented five indicators for 133 countries.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The <em>Doing Business</em> report has had the same effect on policy in many economies that de Soto&#8217;s initial effort had in Peru. In 2005, it was possible to get the permits to start a business in less than 20 days in only 41 economies. In 2016, this is possible in 130 economies. This history should give us the optimism and impatience to keep launching new ideas and to keep striving for better results. The progress to date should give us optimism. The large amount that remains to be done should make us impatient.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><em>Doing Business 2017</em> highlights the large disparities between high- and low-income economies and the higher barriers that women face to starting a business or getting a job compared to men. In 155 economies women do not have the same legal rights as men, much less the supporting environment that is vital to promote entrepreneurship.<sup><a id="forefn-1"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn1">1</a></sup> <em>Doing Business 2017</em> gives prominence to these issues, expanding three indicators&#8212;starting a business, registering property and enforcing contracts&#8212;to account for gender discriminatory practices. But why the gender focus?</p>
<p class="noindentt">Research shows that gender gaps exist in women&#8217;s access to economic opportunities. While women represent 49.6% of the world&#8217;s population, they account <a id="page_vi"/>for only 40.8% of the formal workforce. In emerging markets between 31 and 38% of formal small and medium-size enterprises have at least one woman owner, but their average growth rate is significantly lower than that of male-owned firms.<sup><a id="forefn-2"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn2">2</a></sup> Gender gaps in women&#8217;s entrepreneurship and labor force participation account for an estimated total income loss of 27% in the Middle East and North Africa, a 19% loss in South Asia, a 14% loss in Latin America and the Caribbean and a 10% loss in Europe.<sup><a id="forefn-3"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn3">3</a></sup> Globally, if all women were to be excluded from the labor force income per capita would be reduced by almost 40%.<sup><a id="forefn-4"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindentt">To capture ways in which governments set additional hurdles for women entrepreneurs, <em>Doing Business 2017</em> considers for the first time a number of gender-specific scenarios. The area of company incorporation, for example, now explores whether companies owned by women have the same registration requirements as companies owned by men. It finds that in some economies women must submit additional paperwork or authorizations from their husbands. In the case of property transfers there is a new focus on property ownership and how different sets of rights between men and women affect female entrepreneurs&#8217; access to credit. Finally, when it comes to gender equality in court, the enforcing contracts indicator now highlights places where a woman&#8217;s testimony is given less weight in court than a man&#8217;s, thereby putting her at a fundamental disadvantage in commercial dealings. <em>Doing Business</em> now incorporates these considerations to better reflect the ease of doing business for the widest range of entrepreneurs in a given economy, female entrepreneurs included. The adjustments build on several years of methodology development and cross-country data collection by the <em>Women, Business and the Law</em> project, housed in the Global Indicators Group.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><em>Doing Business 2017</em> also contains a discussion of the role business regulatory reform may play in the global goal to reduce income inequality. Of course there are many determinants of income inequality, including economic growth patterns, the levels and the quality of investments in human capital and the prevalence of bribery and corruption, among many others. Yet some are linked to the regulatory environment for entrepreneurship. Potential entrepreneurs are often discouraged from setting up businesses if the requirements to do so are overly burdensome. When this is the case entrepreneurs often resort to operating within the informal sector which has less protection for labor conditions and is more vulnerable to economic shocks. Having simple, transparent rules for registering a business, paying taxes, getting credit and registering property helps create a level playing field for doing business. Evidence from 175 economies reveals that economies with more stringent entry regulations often experience higher levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini index.<sup><a id="forefn-5"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindentt">At its core, <em>Doing Business</em> seeks to provide quantitative measures of business regulation in 11 regulatory areas that are central to how the private sector functions. A growing body of literature shows that government action to create a sound, predictable regulatory environment is central to whether or not economies perform well and whether that performance is sustainable in the long run.<sup><a id="forefn-6"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn6">6</a></sup> Regulation can aid to correct and prevent traditional types of market failures, such as negative externalities, incomplete markets and information asymmetries. However, regulation can also be used as an intervention when market transactions have led to socially unacceptable outcomes such as improper wealth distribution and inequality.<sup><a id="forefn-7"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn7">7</a></sup> Governments have the ability to design and enforce regulation to help ensure the existence of a level playing field for citizens and economic actors within a society.<sup><a id="forefn-8"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindentt">Business regulations are a specific type of regulation that can encourage growth and protect individuals in the private sector. The role of the private sector is now almost universally recognized as a key driver of economic growth and development. Nearly 90% of employment (including formal and informal jobs) occurs within the private sector&#8212;this sector has abundant potential that should be harnessed.<sup><a id="forefn-9"/><a class="nounder" href="foreword.html#forefn9">9</a></sup> Governments can work together with the private sector to create a thriving business environment. More specifically, effective business regulation can encourage firm start-up and growth as well as minimize the chance for market distortions or failures. Of course, a discussion of the benefits of business regulation must be accompanied by a parallel discussion of its costs. Many businesses complain about the negative impacts of excessive regulation&#8212;or as it is more commonly known, &#8220;red tape.&#8221; The answer is not always more regulation; rather, the more effective answer advocated by <em>Doing Business</em> is smarter regulation, that aims to strike a balance between the need to facilitate the activities of the private sector while providing adequate safeguards for the interests of consumers and other social groups.</p>
<p class="noindentt">More economies are taking up the challenge for reform. New Zealand is the economy with the highest ranking this year, taking over from Singapore. Sub-Saharan African economies are also improving their <em>Doing Business</em> scores at a rate that is three times that of OECD high-income economies. This rate of improvement reflects a low base, but is nonetheless encouraging. Indeed, over the past decade there has been more than a doubling in the number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that are engaged in one or more business regulatory reforms&#8212;a total of 37 economies in this year&#8217;s report. The overarching goal of <em>Doing Business</em> is to help entrepreneurs in low-income economies face the easier business conditions of their counterparts in high-income economies. The data show persuasively that it is facilitating that convergence, and for that we should celebrate.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The story I told above about an idea launched in 1983 in Peru by Hernando de Soto reminds us that ideas gain power as they pass from person to person, <a id="page_vii"/>each of whom improves, extends, or challenges the contributions of others. In the best case, this process of exchange and improvement connects professors in universities, employees of organizations such as the World Bank, government officials, members of civil society organizations, business owners and ordinary citizens. Ideas about improving our institutions will themselves improve only if they keep circulating through this network of people.</p>
<p class="noindentt">We welcome your continued feedback on the <em>Doing Business</em> project. As I start in the role of the World Bank&#8217;s Chief Economist, I am astonished by how much room for improvement there is in everything that people do. This heightens my sense of impatient optimism about the potential for meeting the Bank&#8217;s two goals: ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. <em>Doing Business</em> helps us make progress on one crucial strategy for meeting these goals&#8212;offering market opportunities to everyone. It should also inspire us to be more ambitious about how to carry out other complementary strategies. We depend on you, the reader, to help us shape, improve, extend and replicate this project. You keep its ideas in motion. You give them power.</p>
