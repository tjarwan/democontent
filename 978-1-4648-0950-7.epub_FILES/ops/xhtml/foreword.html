<p class="noindentt">Leaders, policy makers, and development professionals often worry that well-intentioned policies designed to improve the lives of their communities will fail to deliver results.</p>
<p class="indent">The global development community needs to move beyond asking &#8220;What is the right policy?&#8221; and instead ask &#8220;What makes policies work to produce life-improving outcomes?&#8221; The answer put forward in this year&#8217;s <em>World Development Report</em> is better governance&#8212;that is, the ways in which governments, citizens, and communities engage to design and apply policies.</p>
<p class="indent">This Report is being launched at a time when global growth and productivity are continuing to slow, limiting the resources available to help the world&#8217;s poorest and most vulnerable. Yet, people&#8217;s demands for services, infrastructure, and fair institutions are continuing to rise. Given strained government budgets and development aid, it is vital that resources be used as effectively as possible. We can do this by harnessing the finance and skills of private businesses, working even more closely with civil society, and redoubling our efforts in the fight against corruption, one of the biggest roadblocks to effective, lasting development.</p>
<p class="indent">However, coordinating the efforts of this diverse set of groups requires clarity on the roles and responsibilities of each group, along with effective rules of the road to reach and sustain agreements. Without paying greater attention to stronger governance, the World Bank Group&#8217;s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as the transformational vision of the United Nations&#8217; broader Sustainable Development Goals, will be out of reach.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on extensive research and consultations conducted in many countries over the past 24 months, this Report draws attention to the importance of commitment, coordination, and cooperation as the three core functions needed to ensure that policies yield their desired outcomes. The Report also offers a helpful framework for approaching and resolving the challenges faced by our partners. Specifically, it explores how policies for security, growth, and equity can be made more effective by addressing the underlying drivers of governance.</p>
<p class="indent">Moving beyond the traditional concerns about implementation, such as limited state capacity, the Report then digs deeper to understand how individuals and groups with differing degrees of influence and power negotiate the choice of policies, the distribution of resources, and the ways in which to change the rules themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">As the Report shows, positive change is possible. Although reform efforts must be driven by local constituencies, the international community can play an active role in supporting these endeavors. In particular, we need to ensure that our future development assistance fosters the fundamental dynamics that promote better, more sustainable development.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xiv"/>I hope the insights presented in this Report will help countries, their communities, development institutions, and donors succeed in delivering on our shared vision to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.</p>
