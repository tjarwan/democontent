            <p>A screenshot of the author’s Hypothesis public profile page</p>
            <p>The public profile page shows only articles upon which I have made public annotations.
               Any user can select the article to see specific annotations. The tag cloud at the
               right shows all of the tags I have used on publicly visible annotations. In contrast,
               when I visit my personal profile page (featured in <a href="F4.xhtml">Figure 4</a>), I can see all annotations I have made, both public and private, as well as those
               made in collaboration groups.
