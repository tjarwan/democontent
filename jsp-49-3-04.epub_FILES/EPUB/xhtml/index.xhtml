               <p property="schema:text">Hypothesis is an open-source technology developed by a non-profit organization that
                  enables a conversation across all the content on the Web, a rich and interconnected
                  exchange that goes well beyond experiments with past commenting tools. The publication
                  of annotation as a Web standard by the World Wide Web Consortium in February 2017
                  paves the way to bring digital annotation natively to browsers, fulfilling an original
                  vision for networked information laid out by Vannevar Bush in 1945. Publishers are
                  exploring annotation to facilitate post-publication discussion layers, add author
                  or expert commentary as supplemental content, and streamline the peer-review process.
                  Researchers are using annotation for fact verification, entity extraction, precise
                  citation, and preprint collaboration. Annotation technology enables the creation of
                  unique persistent Web addresses that are much more precise than page-level URLs, thus
                  opening up new workflow possibilities in scholarly communications and beyond.

            <p>When I tell folks I work for an annotation technology company, they think initially
               about the ability to add notes on any webpage. However, the technology behind Hypothesis
               enables so much more than that. Since the beginning of the Web, we’ve thought of ‘places’
               on the Web as page-level addresses. It’s all we’ve had, and it’s not very precise.
               Hypothesis technology allows for the creation of a unique persistent Web address for
               a paragraph, a sentence, a word, or a cell in a data file. It’s now possible for one
               URL to have a potentially infinite number of sub-addresses underneath it. Deep linking
               through annotation can connect knowledge across the Web, and it can do so without
               the need for publishers to re-tag or enrich their content in any way.
            </p>
            <p>To help readers understand what annotation technology enables, I will explain how
               annotation differs from the commenting technologies sometimes found on Web content
               today. I will provide background on how Hypothesis was born in 2011 and how it has
               since evolved. I will include some examples of how publishers and researchers are
               using the tool. Finally, I will share some of the ways that Hypothesis is supporting
               the annotation ecosystem in general and how this might affect creators and consumers
               of annotations.

               <h2>Annotations Are Not Comments</h2>
               <p>When I talk to publishers about the power of annotation technology, I sometimes need
                  to overcome preconceptions they have that annotations are merely what we now think
                  of as comments. Current comment systems are rarely used, so why would anyone expect
                  annotation to be any different?
               </p>
               <section id="comments-are-not-collaborative">
                  <h3>Comments Are Not Collaborative</h3>
                  <p>Traditional comments, when they are enabled on publisher websites at all, are relegated
                     to the bottom of webpages, below the fold and well away from the content itself. Only
                     readers of that particular page—and only those who bother to scroll down to the comments—know
                     that others have posted feedback or questions. By contrast, annotations are precise,
                     in-line, and anchored to the text to which they refer, even when a document is revised
                     and edited.<sup><a href="#NT1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></sup> They are easily shareable. When shared, links to annotations bring the receiver not
                     only to the content itself but to the very phrase to which the annotator is referring
                     (<a href="F1.xhtml">Figure 1</a>). Most importantly, open annotation lies across any online text, meaning that researchers
                     can use one standards-based, open-source tool anywhere they are. This means that readers
                     can associate specific annotations with their creators consistently and follow select
                     annotators across the Web.

                  <h3>Comments Have Only One Option: Public</h3>
                  <p>Most of our lives are lived in personal or small-group contexts. Current commenting
                     platforms do not let users take and organize personal notes or allow for the creation
                     of a collaboration group around an individual piece of content, subject area, or project.
                     This group functionality paired with annotations, however, allows a writer to direct
                     his remarks precisely how and to whom he chooses. A group might consist of colleagues
                     or friends, a study group or class, society members, or subscribers. A publisher can
                     choose to control its own moderated annotation layer across its content, deciding
                     who can read and who can write annotations for various purposes, as needs vary.<sup><a href="#NT2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></sup></p>

                  <h3>Commenting Systems Are Proprietary and Siloed</h3>
                  <p>Hypothesis believes that conversations should take place where the content lives online
                     and not be relegated to side conversations on blogs, Twitter, or Reddit. Annotators
                     can create links to additional resources; they can embed images, videos, and equations
                     and anchor them directly to the source text. These annotations can also persist across
                     versions. For publishers whose content sits on multiple platforms, whether that includes
                     aggregator sites or PubMed Central, those different instances can be treated as the
                     same article so that a single conversation can coalesce. Annotations can also link
                     articles to the supporting data, even when the data are distributed in multiple repositories
                     across the Web.<sup><a href="#NT3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></sup></p>
                  <p>In the current proprietary commenting environment, there is no way to get access to
                     every public comment I’ve made anywhere across the Web. There is no way for me to
                     see every comment I’ve ever made.<sup><a href="#NT4" epub:type="noteref">4</a></sup> When I highlight text and make annotations with Hypothesis, however, they populate
                     automatically to my profile page, where I can search them, filter by tags, share them,
                     or return to the document to see my annotations in context (<a href="F2.xhtml">Figure 2</a>). I also have access to every public annotation that has been made anywhere on the
                     Web, so I can explore what others are writing and the content they are writing about.
                     If I want, I can use the Hypothesis application programming interface (API) to get
                     my annotations out for analysis or repurposing. Robust APIs—methods that allow different
                     software systems to communicate effectively—enable publishers or other entities to
                     explore their annotation data or display these data via a widget elsewhere on their
                     platforms.<sup><a href="#NT5" epub:type="noteref">5</a></sup> Annotators should have flexibility in the way their data are stored. The default
                     is for all annotations to be stored on the Hypothesis server; but, for this reason,
                     Hypothesis is evolving to enable the annotation client (the sidebar over the page,
                     in which annotations are created or displayed) to support any service that uses the
                     same annotation standard. Users such as investigative journalists, who need to secure
                     their annotations on their own servers to protect the identities of their sources,
                     will be able to do so.

               <h2>History of Hypothesis</h2>
               <p>Hypothesis users around the world have made over 2.9 million annotations and counting.
                  Just under one quarter of these annotations are public, 33 per cent are private, and
                  43 per cent are shared in collaboration groups (<a href="F3.xhtml">Figure 3</a>). There are more than 140,000 users. In research, writing, peer review, post-publication
                  discussions, or education, Hypothesis enables publishers to plug into scholarly workflows,
                  bringing value to readers and authors and attention to publications.
                  				
                  <!-- The nonlinear content of figure (F3) was moved into the file named F3.xhtml. -->
                  			
               </p>
               <p>Hypothesis was founded in 2011 by Dan Whaley, an entrepreneur who launched the online
                  travel industry in 1995 by creating the first Web-based travel reservation system,
                  Internet Travel Network, which went public in 1999 as GetThere and was later acquired
                  by Sabre, Inc.<sup><a href="#NT6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></sup> Prior to Hypothesis, Dan was focused on climate change and the science to combat
                  it with a start-up called Climos. Noting that much of the information published about
                  climate change was incorrect, misleading, or out of context, Dan imagined crowd-sourcing
                  better information in a layer atop published content. As this technology would ideally
                  be part of the Web itself, it was clear that it needed to be free of the expectations
                  of a venture-backed effort. Dan formed Hypothesis as a public charity, registered
                  in the state of California, on 1 July 2011. It was funded by Kickstarter in November
                  of that year with $105K from over 700 contributors.
               </p>
               <p>Dan drew inspiration from early writings about technology and communication, in particular
                  a July 1945 <em>Atlantic</em> article ‘As We May Think’ by Vannevar Bush.<sup><a href="#NT7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></sup> This piece laid out the vision for what we would come to know as the first Web browser
                  by imagining a ‘mechanized file and library’ that would ‘store all… records, books,
                  and communications.’ Books one wished to consult would be retrieved by a code and
                  projected on a screen. Multiple items could be displayed at one time. In elaborating
                  that a person can ‘add marginal notes and comments’ to these displays, Bush made what
                  is considered to be the first reference to digital annotation.<sup><a href="#NT8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></sup> This dream of Bush’s would be revisited by tech entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen
                  in 1993 when annotation capability—‘the big missing feature from the web browser’—was
                  to be built into Mosaic.<sup><a href="#NT9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></sup> Unfortunately, the hosting of so many potential annotations and the server maintenance
                  that would require were enough to result in the feature’s removal. It would be twenty
                  years before a community would form around open annotation to tackle the challenges
                  and realize the great potential of Bush’s vision.
               </p>
               <p>Because the Hypothesis software is open source, it is permissively licensed and available
                  for download for any purpose. Hypothesis also runs a service through which researchers
                  can create free accounts and annotate for note taking, collaboration, or public critique.
                  Publishers or other organizations can embed a few lines of code on their platforms
                  to enable the annotation tool to be visible to readers. Until 2016, Hypothesis was
                  completely grant funded, with money from Sloan, Mellon, Knight, Helmsley, Omidyar,
                  and others. Hypothesis began a transition to a revenue-based model in 2016 when it
                  partnered with eLife.
               </p>
               <p>An analogy for the Hypothesis business model is WordPress. More than 25 per cent of
                  the sites on the Web run on WordPress technology, and it is free to download and use.<sup><a href="#NT10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></sup> If a person or a business wants additional services, like hosting, storage, or backup,
                  they can pay Automattic, the parent company of Wordpress.com.<sup><a href="#NT11" epub:type="noteref">11</a></sup> While Hypothesis technology can be downloaded by anyone, and our annotation service
                  can be used for free, those who want a customized experience, such as branded and
                  moderated layers, can pay for that service.<sup><a href="#NT12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></sup></p>
               <p>Among annotation software providers, there are a number of players. One of the best
                  known to date is Genius, which began as Rap Genius with a focus on annotating lyrics
                  to rap songs and subsequently expanded to general use. However, in the spring of 2016,
                  Genius retreated from its more general aspirations to refocus on music videos.<sup><a href="#NT13" epub:type="noteref">13</a></sup> Another collaboration start-up in the scholarly space is the Berlin-based PaperHive,
                  which allows users to transfer copies of documents to its hive where they can annotate
                  alone or in teams.<sup><a href="#NT14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></sup> The most recent project is Remarq by Redlink, launched in spring of 2017 with a focus
                  on vetting annotators prior to their annotation on publisher content.<sup><a href="#NT15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></sup> Unlike these other organizations, Hypothesis is incorporated as a 501.c3 non-profit.
                  Hypothesis believes that in order to have the best chance of bringing this new capability
                  forward, a neutral structure is needed that allows Hypothesis to align long term with
                  the interest of users and partners rather than with shareholders.
               </p>
               <p>Both PaperHive and Redlink are members of the Annotating All Knowledge coalition,
                  which is dedicated to supporting annotation across the Web. The World Wide Web Consortium
                  (W3C), the standards body for the Web, approved annotation as a Web standard in February
                  2017 and paved the way for browsers to include the technology natively.<sup><a href="#NT16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></sup> Many coalition members are committed to implementing the new W3C standards with a
                  goal of interoperability. Hypothesis, which worked along with many others to get the
                  standard approved, looks to a future when standards-based annotation clients make
                  it possible for annotations to be seen and interacted with in the same seamless way
                  that email works across multiple clients today. In the near future, I should be able
                  to tell my browser which annotation client I use, just as I would set my preferred
                  search engine, removing the need for plug-ins or bookmarklets.
               </p>
               <p>I joined Hypothesis as Director of Partnerships in December 2016 after nearly two
                  decades in the scholarly communications industry. In this capacity I work with a variety
                  of potential partners, from publishers of all types, to platform hosts, aggregators,
                  and other open-source technology companies. Hypothesis’s partners include the numerous
                  members of the Annotating All Knowledge coalition,<sup><a href="#NT17" epub:type="noteref">17</a></sup> as well as publishers of all sizes that Hypothesis collaborates with directly, including
                  eLife, Michigan Publishing, New York University Press, MIT Press, Johns Hopkins University
                  Press, and the major platform hosts that serve them. I consult with publishers to
                  determine what they hope to accomplish in adding annotation to their content. Then
                  I work with them to define goals and measure progress toward achieving those goals.

               <h2>What Does Annotation Mean for Publishers?</h2>
               <p>There are many uses for annotation in education, mainstream media, investigative journalism,
                  and beyond. The main conversations between Hypothesis and scholarly publishers so
                  far have focused on a few key areas: post-publication annotation of content as a layer
                  over the publisher’s website; streamlining of the peer-review process; and creation
                  of additional content by authors, publisher staff, or invited experts. Publishers,
                  however, are constantly discovering new ways to use the annotation and deep-linking
                  technology to improve workflow and content visibility.

                  <h3>Post-publication Annotation</h3>
                  <p>More publishers are starting to see the discussions attached to their publications
                     via commenting and annotation systems as a complement to a publication’s version of
                     record. As such, they need to feel confident in their ability to apply their own editorial
                     standards to these annotations as they do to the publications themselves. To that
                     end, Hypothesis worked in close collaboration with eLife to define and implement a
                     set of core features that would give publishers an increased level of control over
                     their annotations: the ability to streamline the integration of the annotation tool
                     and the publisher’s own user models and authentication, the ability for publishers
                     to moderate their users’ annotations to ensure civil and on-topic dialogue, and the
                     ability to customize the annotation tool to blend seamlessly into the flow of the
                     publisher’s user experience. As Guiliano Marciocci, Head of Product at eLife, explained,
                     ‘In order to become more widely accepted by the publishing community,… Hypothesis’
                     core annotation tool—initially designed as a universal annotation solution—needed
                     to become much more deeply integrated within publishers’ own workflows and website
                     user experiences. By working closely with Hypothesis, we were able to leverage our
                     expertise in publishing workflows, design and user experience to produce a publisher-friendly
                     annotation solution that also promotes open annotation standards.’<sup><a href="#NT18" epub:type="noteref">18</a></sup></p>
                  <p>To enable and facilitate annotation on content pages, publishers can now elect to
                     control their own annotation layer (separate from the public layer that annotators
                     can choose on their own) and keep it moderated, branded, and visible by default. Readers
                     arriving at a publisher’s webpages can see that annotations exist, and they can explore
                     the annotations. Publishers have options when it comes to reader participation in
                     annotation. Some publishers are choosing to offer recognized users the capability
                     to have an Hypothesis account auto-generated on the basis of an identifier like an
                     ORCID. In this case, there is no need for a reader to log in again in order to create
                     her annotations.
                  </p>
                  <p>In the past two years, Michigan Publishing enabled annotation using Hypothesis for
                     the <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em><sup><a href="#NT19" epub:type="noteref">19</a></sup> and for select titles in its digitalculturebooks imprint. Michigan Publishing also
                     experimented with the tool for some collaborative educational activities during Open
                     Access Week in 2015<sup><a href="#NT20" epub:type="noteref">20</a></sup> and for a community engagement project called Pub Club, which hosted two events designed
                     to promote collaborative annotation, including author participation, for University
                     of Michigan Press titles.<sup><a href="#NT21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></sup> In a presentation at DPLAFest 2017, Rebecca Welzenbach, Director of Strategic Partnerships
                     at Michigan Publishing, noted that ‘so far, we have had the most success with Hypothesis
                     when users are invited to engage as part of a time-bound, real life event, like a
                     class, club or lecture.’<sup><a href="#NT22" epub:type="noteref">22</a></sup></p>

                  <h3>Streamlining Peer Review</h3>
                  <p>Current peer-review processes involve a lot of back and forth in documents that refer
                     to page, paragraph, and sentence numbers, which can force the author or editor to
                     hunt for relevant passages to interpret comments or queries. By using annotation,
                     however, reviewers can connect their remarks directly to the words or sentences in
                     question, and authors can respond <em>in situ</em> as well. Even after the article is edited, the annotations remain anchored to their
                     relevant passages, making it easy for publisher staff to see how reviewer queries
                     were addressed. Whether the process is double-blind, single-blind, or open, peer review
                     through annotation can save time and potential frustration for all parties involved.

                  <p>In September 2017, after a pilot across three journals, the American Geophysical Union
                     announced the availability of annotated peer review across all of its journals.<sup><a href="#NT23" epub:type="noteref">23</a></sup> This capability was made possible through eJournalPress’s integration of Hypothesis
                     into its GEMS editorial system. Tags enable an editor to filter annotations in order
                     to view summary comments, major or minor issues, textual edits, or comments on a figure
                     or reference. Annotations can also be presented in the form of a traditional peer
                     review.

                  <h3>Annotations as Additional Content</h3>
                  <p>Another interest of publishers is using annotations as additional content on their
                     platform. A publisher might choose to make comments from peer reviewers or summaries
                     visible on publications, or ask an author to make updates or connect related resources
                     to a publication for added value. Invited experts might annotate to provide additional
                     insight and context for the published content. Colleagues in marketing might connect
                     media mentions directly to publications and tweet out the links.
                  </p>
                  <p>The American Astronomical Society (AAS) is one publisher that uses annotation to enrich
                     its publications: ‘We think it is important for authors to enrich their articles with
                     data and believe that a publisher annotation layer is one way to describe and maintain
                     those data enrichments. Articles in the [AAS] Journals can now contain links to data
                     behind figures, rich metadata enhanced tables, and animated or interactive data visualizations.
                     It can be difficult to highlight and explain such materials for readers,’ noted August
                     Muench, Journals Data Scientist at the AAS. ‘For example, readers may want to be told
                     about the most up to date techniques for using such enhanced tables, which we could
                     provide in an annotation layer. We also are exploring post-publication enrichment
                     of articles with data from third party repositories such as the Strasbourg Astronomical
                     Data Center, where context and description are very important to convey what new material
                     (or even new data services) has become available for a particular article.’<sup><a href="#NT24" epub:type="noteref">24</a></sup></p>
                  <p>Hypothesis enables annotation on text formats and data for now, with an expectation
                     of supporting annotation on images and video in the future. Until recently only html
                     and PDF were supported, but in early 2017, New York University (NYU) Press, Hypothesis,
                     the Readium Foundation, Evident Point, and EPUB.js joined forces to implement the
                     changes necessary to support the annotation of EPUBs. With a new books platform launching
                     in 2018, NYU Press wanted to enable easy annotation of its EPUB files. The project
                     was completed in the fall of 2017, and annotation capabilities were included in the
                     0.28 Readium.js release and are supported by recent EPUB.js versions.<sup><a href="#NT25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></sup> ‘This integration is strategic for us,’ said David Millman, Assistant Dean for Digital
                     Library Technology Services at NYU, ‘and we hope it will be helpful to many more and
                     wider communities too. This effort could have a huge impact on the way people continue
                     working with books, and with each other.’<sup><a href="#NT26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></sup></p>

                  <p>Annotation can be part of any workflow that involves documents or webpages. The American
                     Society for Microbiology (ASM) has been preparing to migrate a number of journals

                     across fourteen journal sites. While in process, the pages exist on a staging site
                     accessible only to ASM staff. ‘As the pages are developed, we use Hypothesis to indicate
                     where text changes, formatting changes, and massive updates are needed,’ explained
                     Deborah Plavin, Online Publishing Manager for the ASM. ‘It’s been an easier way for
                     us to manage the numerous edits that need to be made and the conversations happening
                     around those pages. We can even use annotations to link to content that needs to be

                  <p>Maryann Martone, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of California at San
                     Diego and Director of Biosciences at Hypothesis, reported that the ability to annotate
                     articles has completely changed the way she researches and reads: ‘Prior to using
                     Hypothesis, I routinely downloaded and printed out articles to read when I was researching
                     a paper or topic. If I thought about it, I would import the paper into a reference
                     manager to make it easy to reference later, but often I did that step completely after
                     I wrote the manuscript. But since coming to Hypothesis, I find that the ability to
                     take notes anchored to specific passages of text, and have them tagged and searchable
                     across papers, are such major benefits that I prefer to read articles online.’<sup><a href="#NT28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></sup></p>
                  <p>I myself have experienced a similar change in behaviour. My previous preparation for
                     industry events or blog posts involved pasting URLs for articles of interest into
                     a Word document. Inevitably, when I prepared to write or create slides for speaking,
                     I could no longer recall why I thought the articles were relevant. Now, as every item
                     I annotate automatically populates to my Hypothesis profile page, I find it easy to
                     keep my multiple obligations straight. In fact, I’m hesitant to read without Hypothesis,
                     as I wonder how I might ever find the article again (<a href="F4.xhtml">Figure 4</a>).

                  <h3>Entity Extraction and Linking</h3>
                  <p>In an era of increasing information overload, standard identifiers have become critical
                     to disambiguate terms, people, and other entities in publication and research workflows,
                     but the identifiers used in published papers often exist apart from the information
                     to which they point. Annotation is a way to bring visibility to this information atop
                     the publisher’s version of record. It also allows readers to interact with annotation
                     cards to explore information via tags or to ask questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>More than 125 neuroscience journals support the inclusion of RRIDs (research resource
                     identifiers), which give information that is critical for reproducibility purposes
                     when a researcher needs to know, say, which precise stem-cell line was used or where
                     a particular reagent was purchased in the conduct of an experiment.<sup><a href="#NT30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></sup> A team at the University of California at San Diego used Hypothesis technology to
                     create an account called SciBot.<sup><a href="#NT31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></sup> When Hypothesis is enabled, SciBot looks for RRIDs in the html or PDF of a document
                     and returns relevant information from an external database in the form of annotation
                     cards alongside an article. Researchers can see details about the particular RRID
                     and can click on the resulting tag to explore other articles that reference the same
                     identifier.
                  </p>
                  <p>This technology could be used for any identifier included in a publication to bring
                     external information right to the publisher webpage. For instance, August Muench of
                     the AAS emphasized that astronomers make use of services such as the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
                     Database (NED) and the Simbad Astronomical Database at the Centre de Données astronomiques
                     de Strasbourg (CDS) that identify and catalogue astrophysical objects (and data) in
                     published papers.<sup><a href="#NT32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></sup> A problem for the reader is that these services currently exist apart from the original
                     article, and catalogued objects are outside the immediate context of the text. Open
                     annotation platforms provide a way to bring those entities back in line with the article,
                     allowing the reader to understand the newly published data alongside the historical
                     catalogue.

                     of links and annotations, ready to be shared. I then used the automation service IFTTT
                     (if this, then that) to update a dedicated “Readings” channel on Slack, based on the
                     open Hypothesis RSS feed.’<sup><a href="#NT35" epub:type="noteref">35</a></sup></p>

                  <h3>Collaboration on Preprints</h3>
                  <p>Submitting papers to preprint servers for collaboration and feedback from colleagues
                     goes back many years in some fields like physics, but it is a more recent development
                     in other disciplines. While preprints offer early access to research findings and
                     an opportunity for researchers to receive input from a wide audience of their peers,
                     the mechanisms in place to gather that input are lacking. Enabling annotations on
                     preprints facilitates discussions on many levels. Adding robust annotation capability
                     that researchers can use in the preprint environment and also across the Web can accelerate
                     conversations and link related research regardless of where it is hosted. In describing
                     the potential of annotation to enrich preprints, Richard Sever, bioRxiv Cofounder
                     and Assistant Director at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, noted, ‘Hypothesis’
                     vision of an open, standards-driven approach to web annotation… has immense potential
                     to increase discussion, clarification, and critical analysis of academic papers, which
                     will benefit authors and readers. It should be particularly important for preprints
                     on bioRxiv since they are rapid communications of new research that have yet to undergo
                     any formal assessment by the scientific community.’<sup><a href="#NT36" epub:type="noteref">36</a></sup> In addition, connecting annotation technology to manuscript submission systems makes
                     it possible for peer reviewers to see what changes were made and what issues were
                     resolved in earlier versions. Now that preprint versions are assigned DOIs, it is
                     also possible to connect annotations on both the preprint and the published versions.

               <h2>Supporting an Annotation Ecosystem</h2>
               <p>A key initiative to promote ubiquitous annotation is the annual I Annotate conference,
                  hosted by Hypothesis, which will be held for the sixth time in the spring of 2018.
                  In May 2017, more than 100 annotation enthusiasts gathered in San Francisco for a
                  partner meeting, two days of annotation-inspired conference programming, and a hack
                  day.<sup><a href="#NT37" epub:type="noteref">37</a></sup> Digital pioneer Esther Dyson gave the keynote address, and conference panels covered
                  annotation in publishing, education, research, and investigative journalism. Case
                  studies and flash demo sessions provided new projects and companies with the opportunity
                  to update attendees on their products and initiatives.
               </p>
               <p>In the fall of 2015, Hypothesis started the Annotating All Knowledge coalition to
                  promote and explore interoperable standards-based annotation.<sup><a href="#NT38" epub:type="noteref">38</a></sup> This coalition, which is free to join, now numbers more than seventy members, including
                  publishers, universities, and technology companies. Members understand that an annotation
                  layer must evolve as an open, interoperable, and shared capability, aligned with the
                  motivations and interests of researchers. Members agree to collaborate openly with
                  their peers, to share experiences, and to work together toward mutual objectives,
                  as Patrick Johnson explained: ‘Building on the very machinery that enables the Web
                  to function, the result is a standard way to enable comments and conversations in
                  context, in a way that is not bound to a specific platform, publisher, or encoding,
                  and in a way that makes it simple and intuitive for people to talk to people and learn
                  from each other, and build vibrant communities that extend human knowledge.’<sup><a href="#NT39" epub:type="noteref">39</a></sup></p>
               <p>The coalition has met twice, each time prior to an annual FORCE11 meeting. In October
                  2017, Annotating All Knowledge teamed up with the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation
                  for a day of programming around open tools. The annotation track focused on FAIR (findable,
                  accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles, with the dual goal of making
                  annotations FAIR and using annotations to make all content FAIR.<sup><a href="#NT40" epub:type="noteref">40</a></sup></p>
               <p>The open annotation community includes a wide variety of people from all over the
                  world.<sup><a href="#NT41" epub:type="noteref">41</a></sup> Many participate on social media channels<sup><a href="#NT42" epub:type="noteref">42</a></sup> and within the Annotating All Knowledge community, which offers an open Slack channel
                  for discussion that continues beyond face-to-face meetings.<sup><a href="#NT43" epub:type="noteref">43</a></sup> FORCE11, an organization comprising researchers, librarians, publishers, and funders
                  who want to use information technology to improve scholarship, also hosts the Annotating
                  All Knowledge Working Group, which is free to join.<sup><a href="#NT44" epub:type="noteref">44</a></sup></p>
               <p>Educators and students are very active in annotation, together producing the majority
                  of Hypothesis annotations to date. A high school student in Huntington Beach, California,
                  made the millionth Hypothesis annotation as part of a class assignment.<sup><a href="#NT45" epub:type="noteref">45</a></sup> While most of the annotations made in educational settings are conducted in private
                  groups to protect student privacy, educators from around the world participate in
                  collaborative annotation projects like Marginal Syllabus.<sup><a href="#NT46" epub:type="noteref">46</a></sup> Hypothesis is currently extending access to annotation capabilities for teachers
                  and students by integrating its software with the most common learning management
                  systems in use at institutions of higher learning and many K–12 schools.

               <h2>Conclusion: Users Are Helping to Drive Innovation in Annotation</h2>
               <p>With the W3C standard in place, conditions are right for interoperable Web annotation
                  to flourish. More open tools are being launched to connect with publisher and researcher
                  workflows. The ability for annotation technology to make very precise Web sub-addresses
                  creates new possibilities for information exchange.
               </p>
               <p>Every day I learn about new potential use cases from publishers and researchers. Some
                  are exploring annotation in the production workflow by annotating their XML staging
                  sites to ask questions of in-house colleagues and external vendors on top of the code
                  itself. Still others have suggested annotations to enable micro-attributions, either
                  to detail who did what in a paper or who reviewed what in the peer review process.
                  An editorial colleague even suggested that annotation could be used to prevent accidental
                  plagiarism: with the cited selection from the original made visible, along with any
                  notes the author made, annotation makes a side-by-side comparison of passages simple.
                  An accessibility specialist spoke to me about using annotation to enable users to
                  input descriptions for images and figures that lack metadata. Each one of these uses
                  is exciting; but, when people ask me what is the most interesting use of annotation
                  I’ve heard about, I laugh and say it is probably the one I will hear about later today.
