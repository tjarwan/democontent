<h2 class="h2a"><em>HELPING PATIENTS WITH CHANGE</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">Change is one of the few constants in life. It is one of the few things that we can be certain will occur. Yet, most of us are not completely comfortable with change. Not only do people differ in their comfort with or tolerance for change, but for each person different kinds of changes produce different kinds of responses. As John Kenneth Galbraith once stated, when people are given a choice between changing and proving that it&#8217;s not necessary, most people get busy with the proof. Given their current level and response to stress (change), people use their best problem-solving strategies to get their needs met, even if these strategies are dysfunctional. That is, people do what they know until they learn something new. Often, when faced with change, people do things that appear to be irrational. But if we are patient and look closely, we may discover that the person is using what he or she knows to attempt to get a need met. For example, some patients may stay ill intentionally, because by doing so they get attention that they need. Knowing this may prompt the pharmacist to give the patient attention for healthy behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent">Managing an illness requires behavior change. For example, to manage diabetes patients must take their medicine properly, monitor their blood glucose, often change their eating habits, and get sufficient exercise. These changes, especially lifestyle changes, are not easy. In the face of such changes, people often avoid the critical choices they need to make.</p>
<p class="indent">It is normal for people to resist change until they believe the change is actually good for them. Each of us has an internal decisional balance on which we weigh the pros and cons of making a change. We do this both quantitatively and qualitatively: We do not use just the numbers of pros and cons in deciding for or against a change; we also weigh the <a id="page_108"/>importance or salience of those pros and cons. For example, a patient may see many benefits in taking a particular medication for reducing his blood pressure, but he may decide not to get the prescription filled if the cost is prohibitive. In discussing medication use with our patients, we need to make sure they understand the benefits (the pros) and know how to overcome the barriers (the cons). Otherwise, the balance may be tipped against taking the medicine. Why would a patient want to endure injection pain if he doesn&#8217;t see the benefits of the injected medication? Ambivalence about and resistance to change occur when the pros do not outweigh the cons or the cons clearly outweigh the pros. Later in this chapter, we will discuss this further.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the massive changes taking place in health care in general and pharmacy in particular, and given the changes required of patients when they have to manage an illness, this chapter on change is a long one. It will discuss emotional and behavioral responses to change, the internal processes people use to change, the stages of change that people go through, how we can assist people with change, how to assess a person&#8217;s readiness for change, how to choose appropriate skills and intervention strategies to match a person&#8217;s readiness to change, and finally, a process for improving patients&#8217; readiness to manage their illness.</p>
<h3 class="h3">EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO CHANGE</h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.1">Table 9-1</a> lists various emotional reactions to change. <a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.2">Table 9-2</a> lists some reasons change is difficult emotionally. Let&#8217;s look at each reaction, the reasons, and how we might effectively respond to these emotions and reasons. Later in the chapter we will explore in more depth how to deal with resistance to change.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Fear, anxiety, and ambivalence.</strong> When faced with the need to change, we may become anxious or frightened. We may question our capacity to make the change and our self-efficacy relative to the change. Do we have the necessary skills? Do we know what is required of us? Is the change really going to be beneficial? Will training be available if we need it? Will others think we&#8217;re stupid (or inept or clumsy) if we have difficulty at first? Do we know all we need to know about the illness and its treatment? Do we have unanswered questions? All of these issues can cause us to feel fearful or anxious. If these questions are not adequately answered, we feel ambivalent about or resistant to the change, and ambivalence is the primary reason people will not make a change. They don&#8217;t know what to do, how to do it, or if they can do it. Ambivalence shuts people down and causes them to proceed either with great caution or not at all. When people are ambivalent, they often maintain the old behavior(s) because of familiarity. The same is true of resistance. Resistance is a more active form of ambivalence.</p>

<p class="indentt">To help someone with the process of change, these issues must be addressed. Listening and empathic responding (discussed in <a href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>) are very important here. People&#8217;s fears and concerns must be taken seriously and responded to in a respectful way. The fear or anxiety needs to be honored (&#8220;So, you are concerned that you may not have all of the resources that you need to make the necessary changes&#8221;), not disparaged. Attempting to minimize the fear (&#8220;Oh come on, it&#8217;s not so bad&#8221;) is not an effective way to gain trust. Comparing the person with others (&#8220;Other patients haven&#8217;t had difficulties with this&#8221;) is also not very effective.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Anger, blaming, and scapegoating.</strong> It is not unusual for people to become angry or defensive when faced with change, particularly if they do not feel they have been involved in the process or the decisions that have been made that will affect them directly. Therefore, when helping employees or patients deal with change, participation and feedback are essential.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>, anger is an emotion that is often used to mask another emotion such as fear, anxiety, or frustration. Rather than admitting that they feel afraid as a result of change, people often convert that to anger because anger feels more powerful and less &#8220;weak.&#8221; What sometimes follows this angry response is blaming, scapegoating, or some form of discounting. People begin to blame someone or something, calling the change silly or unnecessary and explaining why they can&#8217;t make the change or why it won&#8217;t work. They may discount the <a id="page_110"/>importance of the change so that they don&#8217;t have to do anything. After all, if the change is not important, then why should they invest in it?</p>
<p class="indent">The key is to understand that these kinds of responses indicate that people feel threatened and anxious about the change. Perceived threats need to be explored and understood rather than minimized. Individuals need to be respectfully confronted with statements like &#8220;From what you have said, I assume that you don&#8217;t believe the change is necessary. Tell me why. I&#8217;d like your input,&#8221; or &#8220;Given the problem we&#8217;re having, what would you propose instead?&#8221; We can hold the person responsible for his or her statements and behavior without being punitive or shaming.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Going numb, or avoidance.</strong> One response to change is to avoid it altogether&#8212;to go numb and act as though nothing has changed: If I don&#8217;t think about it, it will go away. Even though most of us would agree that this is unhealthy, it is still one way that people cope when they feel threatened.</p>
<p class="indent">Going numb can also mean deciding to do nothing rather than change because enough other people have made this same decision&#8212;even though all involved know that this decision may be harmful to themselves or others. For example, some pharmacists do not counsel their patients, even though they know that by doing this (nothing) they place their patients at risk. They use the fact that other pharmacists shirk this responsibility as justification for their inaction. Time and lack of reimbursement are often used as excuses for this inaction. However, time and money are surely less important than a human life.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Excitement, joy, and relief.</strong> Some patients may actually experience these emotions when they are diagnosed with an illness. For example, the patient who finds out she has diabetes may experience relief at finally knowing why she has felt so bad for so long. Knowing that the illness is controllable, she experiences relief and a sense of being in charge of her life again. For many people, change can be exciting if it clearly represents something better for them, whether that be working conditions, technology, health, or some other part of life.</p>
<p class="indent">Positive reactions to change should be verbally recognized or supported. If a patient is doing a particularly good job of managing his or her illness, this should be acknowledged (&#8220;I like that you are refilling your medicine on time and regularly monitoring your blood pressure&#8221;) so that desired behaviors are repeated. It is unfortunate that too often we focus on things people do that we don&#8217;t like, rather than on all the things they do that we do like. We sometimes ask ourselves why we should praise people for doing what they&#8217;re supposed to be doing. The answer is quite simple. We want them to keep doing it. All of us like to be recognized for our accomplishments.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_111"/><strong>Frustration.</strong> This is a common response to change. For reasons similar to those described for anger, change can be very frustrating when people affected by the change are not involved in the process and have not been asked for feedback. Again, the reasons for the frustration need to be explored rather than minimized.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Depression, both existential and clinical.</strong> When people are faced with change, even if they can see its benefits, depression sometimes occurs. This is particularly true when people find out that they have an illness that they will have to treat for life. Many times, the chronic illness is a harsh reminder that they are not immortal or that they are growing older. The feeling that they will live forever has been quickly jerked away, and this is difficult to accept immediately. When patients begin to express this sense of loss, which is healthy, too many health care providers and others try to fix the problem rather than being emotionally available to the person with the illness. This fixing includes statements like &#8220;Cheer up. At least you know what it is&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s not so bad. Millions of people have diabetes (or high blood pressure or asthma or whatever), and it&#8217;s treatable.&#8221; These statements minimize the importance of the patient&#8217;s feelings&#8212;how he or she is currently experiencing the illness. Simply listening to the patient and reflecting back your understanding of the patient&#8217;s perspective is far more powerful.</p>
<p class="indent">A distinction needs to be made between existential depression and clinical depression. Existential means that the feeling moves the patient forward; it promotes existence. When we are faced with change, even if the change is positive, we must give up some part of how we used to be to become something new. This creates a sense of loss that can be experienced as depression. If you have ever been in a funk for a day or two and could not for the life of you explain why, chances are very good that some important change was taking place in your life. Clinical depression, on the other hand, is much more severe and prolonged. Clinical depression can result from major change in a person&#8217;s life. It needs to be taken seriously by health care providers and treated by a therapist, with drug therapy, or both.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Feeling out of control.</strong> When faced with change, particularly sudden or chaotic change, people often feel out of control. To feel more in control, they revert back to old, familiar behaviors, numb out, blame someone, discount the change, or make the change. To encourage the person to make the change, it is important to understand the reasons for feeling out of control and examine ways the person might feel more in control of what is happening.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Shame or guilt.</strong> People may feel ashamed or guilty when faced with change. If the change is threatening, like a chronic illness or a change in their job description, some people believe the change is a <a id="page_112"/>result of past &#8220;sinful&#8221; behavior. They believe that in some way they deserve the &#8220;punishment&#8221; being inflicted on them. This is regrettable. Because these thoughts are irrational, they cannot be dealt with by reasoning. Listening and empathy are important. Staying focused on the task at hand is also vital. For example, Mrs. Jones states, &#8220;I just know I got diabetes because I ate too many sweets as a kid.&#8221; The pharmacist responds, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what we can do to get your diabetes under control so that you can live a long, healthy life,&#8221; rather than &#8220;Oh, Mrs. Jones, I&#8217;m sure that has nothing to do with this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Feeling alone in the world.</strong> Even when people realize that they need to change, it can feel very lonely. People may receive help with the change, but ultimately change is most often made at the individual level. This can be frightening. Our primary fear is being alone in the world. One of the most powerful things pharmacists can do to help patients make necessary changes is to be emotionally available and reflect back their understanding. If a problem can be understood, it can be solved. This provides hope. Hope provides energy for change.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Change can be difficult. It is our emotional reaction that often determines whether a change will be embraced or avoided. Depending on their abilities, insights, beliefs, values, and perceptions, people respond differently to the same change. Each response needs to be honored and explored, even if a change must ultimately be made. We should not presume to know how the patient is responding to the required change, but instead should explore his or her feelings, empathize with these feelings, and help formulate the problem in a productive way that makes sense to the patient.</p>
<h3 class="h3">READINESS FOR CHANGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the first part of this chapter we discussed people&#8217;s emotional reactions to change and why they have these varied reactions. Now we will examine change from the perspective of a patient&#8217;s readiness to manage an illness, particularly a chronic illness. Managing an illness often requires changes in multiple behaviors. For example, patients with diabetes will need to use their medications correctly, exercise, change their diet, and monitor their blood glucose. They will not necessarily engage in each of these behaviors equally well, nor are they likely to engage in each of the behaviors with the same degree of motivation or commitment. This part of the chapter will examine a model of change and discuss how pharmacists and other health care providers can assist patients in managing their illnesses.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_113"/>TRANSTHEORETICAL MODEL OF CHANGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">During the 1970s and 1980s, Prochaska and colleagues did an exhaustive examination of the literature on change.<sup><a id="ch9-ref1" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref1">1</a></sup>,<sup><a id="ch9-ref2" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref2">2</a></sup> They looked at why and how people change in therapy, why they do not change, and why and how they change outside of therapy. They examined change across more than 200 different psychotherapies. The objective was to develop a comprehensive model that could be used to predict how ready an individual is for change and how to intervene to assist the individual in making the change.</p>
<p class="indent">From this research, the transtheoretical model of change was developed. In summary, Prochaska and colleagues were able to identify 5 stages of readiness for change (<a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.3">Table 9-3</a>) and 10 processes of change (<a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.4">Table 9-4</a>) that individuals use to move from one stage of readiness to the next. In other words, change is not an either/or process.<sup><a id="ch9-ref3" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref3">3</a></sup>,<sup><a id="ch9-ref4" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref4">4</a></sup> People often cycle through the five stages of change (or readiness) before the change is internalized and habituated. The first three stages are cognitive. That is, people think about the change and weigh the pros and cons of making the change. They also decide whether they have the skills and resources to make the necessary changes (self-efficacy). While in each stage of readiness, people use different internal processes (<a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.4">Table 9-4</a>) to move to the next stage.</p>
<p class="indent">It is the health care provider&#8217;s task to assess the patient&#8217;s readiness to manage the target behaviors and then use stage-specific skills and strategies to stimulate the internal processes used to motivate change and help the patient move to the next stage of readiness. Notice that the task is not necessarily to move the patient directly to action. It is to help the patient move to the next stage.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, one internal process is consciousness-raising. It is the most-used process of change. Increasing the information available to the patient can help the patient make better choices. For patients with diabetes to successfully manage their illness, they must first know enough about the illness and how to control it. Therefore, their understanding of the illness and its treatment must be assessed and then appropriate information must be communicated. Although education does not predict adherence, it is vital that patients assimilate <em>accurate</em> information and understand its relevance to their situation so that they have a reasonable chance to succeed. Thus, education is an intervention that can stimulate the internal process, consciousness-raising, in the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">This model is very powerful, yet sometimes it presents difficulties for health care providers who have a strong need for control or believe that <em>they</em> manage the patient&#8217;s illness. In reality, we cannot control, motivate, or save the patient. Nor do health care providers manage an illness. Patients manage illnesses, or they don&#8217;t. What we <em>can</em> do is provide sufficient, understandable information in a caring, trusting context in which patients feel safe enough and free enough to discuss their successes and problems in managing their illnesses. In addition, we can use patient-centered skills and strategies to help patients move toward healthy behaviors. We need to really listen to the patient instead of presuming to know the patient&#8217;s situation, and to provide only information that directly relates to the patient&#8217;s concerns, problem, and worries.</p>

<p class="indentt"><a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.5">Table 9-5</a> contrasts the biomedical (paternalistic) model of care with a socio-behavioral model of care. The biomedical model is one in which the health care provider is in control. In the socio-behavioral model, the patient and provider are partners who negotiate care. The biomedical model works well in controlled settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. However, it does not work well at all when the patient is ambulatory and can choose whether or not to follow a treatment regimen; this is where socio-behavioral models (such as the transtheoretical model) work best.</p>

<h3 class="h3">SOME IMPORTANT CONTRASTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before further discussion of the stages of change, let&#8217;s look at some important contrasts (<a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.6">Table 9-6</a>). When people are faced with change, initially the change may seem foreign to them. This is especially true when they are told they have a chronic illness to manage. They may say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not happening to me&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s not really that serious.&#8221; In other words, they don&#8217;t accept what is happening to them. Until the change or illness is internalized or integrated and becomes part of who the person is, the change is unlikely to take place. Empathy, understanding, and education assist in the process of internalization.</p>
<p class="indent">Ambivalence is a major reason people don&#8217;t change. If they don&#8217;t know what to do or how to do it, or do not believe they have the skills or resources to do what is necessary, change usually does not occur. And if they don&#8217;t believe that the pros of making the change outweigh the cons, they won&#8217;t change. Interventions that help people understand what is needed, the benefits that will result, and how to minimize or overcome real or perceived barriers are often useful. In addition, dissonance about not changing is a powerful promoter of change. If people believe that staying the same will create more problems than changing, change is more likely. Dissonance stimulates self-re-evaluation. In order to change, the patient must decide that he will like himself more as a result of the changes. More on creating dissonance later.</p>
<p class="indent">People are less likely to change if they feel coerced or feel their freedom is being impinged on. People are more likely to change when they believe the decision is theirs. Good decision-making is aided by accurate, nonjudgmental information, empathic understanding, and emphasis on the benefits of making the change.</p>

</table>
<p class="indentt">Finally, helping relationships are far more likely than paternalism (treating patients like children) to move people toward change. Helping relationships involve the patient in the decision-making, respect that this change is only part of what is occurring in the patient&#8217;s life, and allow the patient to express fears, doubts, or concerns. Helping relationships stimulate self-liberation: Patients feel free to make better choices. Still, there are patients who want to be told exactly what to do and when. But even this is a choice that the patient, not the health care provider, is making.</p>
<h3 class="h3">THE STAGES OF CHANGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next we will discuss a process for assessing the patient&#8217;s readiness to engage in a behavior and identifying perceived barriers to change and possible benefits of change. The stages of change and the interventions and skills to be used by the pharmacist in each stage are summarized in <a href="chapter9.xhtml#tab9.3">Table 9-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Precontemplation.</strong> This is the first stage of readiness. Individuals in this stage are unaware, unwilling, or too discouraged to change. For the precontemplator who is unaware, the best strategy is education. For example, people with diabetes cannot effectively manage their illness if they do not understand the illness or its treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are aware but unwilling, a different approach is needed. Many smokers are aware of the dangers of smoking but continue to smoke. Here, a strategy is to ask the smoker what he or she likes about smoking. If the smoker says, &#8220;It relaxes me,&#8221; a helpful response is, &#8220;It would be hard to give up something that is relaxing.&#8221; This response does not put the patient on the defensive and, in fact, demonstrates nonjudgmental understanding. After asking what else the smoker likes about smoking, ask what he or she sees as the downside of smoking. Summarize all that you have heard, saying, &#8220;So, on the one hand you like smoking because&#8230;while on the other hand you see the downside of smoking as&#8230;&#8221; This is called <em>developing discrepancies</em>. <a id="page_118"/>Saying the pros and cons out loud creates dissonance, and dissonance creates motivation for change.</p>
<p class="indent">To assess just how resistant to change the patient is, the &#8220;envelope&#8221; method is recommended. Using our smoking example, you would say, &#8220;Mr. Smith, if I were to hand you an envelope, what message would have to be inside it for you to consider quitting?&#8221; Hard-core precontemplators will tell you, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any message that could get me to quit.&#8221; Some patients have no intention of changing, and we cannot save them. We would simply say, &#8220;Mr. Smith, it sounds like you&#8217;re not ready to quit smoking. I am concerned that your smoking increases your chances for a stroke or heart attack because of your high blood pressure, but it really is up to you whether you want to quit. If you get to the point where you are considering quitting, let me know and I will be glad to help you with some methods for doing so.&#8221; On the other hand, when asked about the envelope, some patients might say, &#8220;I guess if I found out that I had early warning signs of problems.&#8221; Now you can ask them to consider getting their lungs checked so they can make a better decision about whether to consider quitting.</p>
<p class="indent">A similar method for dealing with resistant patients uses &#8220;readiness rulers&#8221; to assess both how important the patient perceives managing the illness to be and how self-efficacious he or she feels about doing so. Readiness rulers for measuring importance would go like this: &#8220;On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is not at all important and 7 is extremely important, how important to you is taking your medicine properly to manage your diabetes?&#8221; Let&#8217;s say that the patient answers &#8220;3.&#8221; The mistake the health care provider typically makes is to say, &#8220;Why a 3 and not a 7?&#8221; This response forces patients to talk negatively about the behavior&#8212;for example, why they don&#8217;t think it is important to take their medicine. A more productive response is to say, &#8220;Why a 3 and not a 1?&#8221; This elicits change talk from the patient. If the patient says &#8220;1,&#8221; you know the patient is not ready, and an appropriate response would be, &#8220;It does not sound like you are ready to take your medicine as prescribed. What would have to happen for you to be ready?&#8221; After listening carefully to the patient&#8217;s answer to &#8220;Why a 3 and not a 1?&#8221; it is useful to then say, &#8220;What would have to happen for you to move to a 4?&#8221; This gets the patient thinking about change, but in a small, incremental way. It helps the patient think about change and what it would take to be more committed to change, but it does so in an incremental way. Asking about a 6 or 7 at this point would be too much and could cause resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are too discouraged to change, it is helpful to identify any successes they have had in past change attempts. Identifying what worked, even for a short period of time, can help the patient repeat these actions for longer periods.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_119"/><strong>Contemplation.</strong> In this stage, patients are more open to information and want to learn more. They are thinking of changing in the next 6 months. Providing objective, nonjudgmental information is very important in this stage. Noticing the patient&#8217;s statements indicating a shift in his or her stage of readiness is also important. Asking the patient what he or she anticipates will be the greatest obstacles and what he or she perceives as the benefits of the change is very useful.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Preparation.</strong> The patient is getting ready to try something in the next 30 days. It is not until this stage that any action-oriented strategies are considered. Setting small goals and removing barriers to change are very important in this stage. Discussing the patient&#8217;s plan for action and praising his or her readiness also are very important.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Action.</strong> This stage is critical. A great deal of effort is being made. The patient has now engaged in the behavior(s), but for less than 6 months. Often we think our work is done at this point, but it is really just beginning. Patients need to be noticed. The new behaviors need to be reinforced. &#8220;Cheerleading&#8221; and social support are essential. Unfortunately, major improvements may go unnoticed because health care providers and family can&#8217;t understand why they should praise a patient for doing what he&#8217;s supposed to be doing. The answer is simple. You want him to keep doing it. Statements like &#8220;Mr. Jones, I noticed that you were right on time for your blood pressure medicine this month. Way to go. I wish more of my patients took their blood pressure as seriously as you do. How have you been able to get yourself on track? I&#8217;d like to be able to tell some of my other patients&#8221; are very helpful and encouraging.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Maintenance.</strong> In this stage, the patient has been engaged in the target behavior(s) for at least 6 months. Again, noticing the positive changes is very important. Relapse prevention is a focus of this stage. At some time or another, patients may relapse. The smoker may smoke, the patient with diabetes may get off his diet, and so on. The key is to stay focused on attacking problems, not people. For example:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mrs. Jones, what happened to cause your blood glucose to go up?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: We had a rash of birthdays at work. You know, cake, ice cream, the works. I overindulged.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: OK, that happens now and then. Since you were doing a great job of keeping your diabetes under control, I know that you&#8217;ll get back on track. What&#8217;s your plan?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Smaller piece of cake, no ice cream.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_120"/>The pharmacist&#8217;s communication is supportive, encouraging, and nonjudgmental.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY OF THE TRANSTHEORETICAL MODEL</h3>
<p class="noindent">The transtheoretical model of change helps us to understand that change is a process and each stage of the process requires different skills and strategies for effectively helping the patient to change. This model helps us understand that information provision, while necessary and important, is not enough; if information were enough, no one would smoke. It is critical to identify sources of ambivalence or resistance to change.</p>
<h3 class="h3">MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now we will take what we have learned about change and put it all together in a process called motivational interviewing. This process will assist you in using the skills and concepts we have discussed. A step-by-step approach will help you identify the patient&#8217;s readiness and understanding. In addition, you will be shown how all of this fits into patient counseling and medication history taking.</p>
<p class="indent">Motivational interviewing was originally developed by Miller and Rollnick<sup><a id="ch9-ref5" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref5">5</a></sup> as a complementary process to the transtheoretical model of change. It was first targeted toward people with addictive behaviors but, with the development of brief motivational interviewing, it is now being used to assist health care providers in managing patients with other illnesses.<sup><a id="ch9-ref6" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref6">6</a></sup> The object of motivational interviewing and brief motivational interviewing is to negotiate behavior change with a patient or client.</p>
<p class="indent">As developed by Miller and Rollnick,<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref5">5</a></sup> motivational interviewing is both a way of being with the patient and a strategy for helping patients make a commitment to change. The way of being, or spirit, of motivational interviewing sees the patient as someone who weighs the pros and cons or benefits and barriers of making a change and, as a result, decides to engage in a behavior (such as taking medicine or losing weight) or does not engage until the pros outweigh the cons. This concept is called decisional balance. Patients are not seen as lazy or unmotivated. Patients who continue to smoke are seen as people who simply believe that the benefits of smoking still outweigh the risks. They may have an unrealistic understanding of the benefits and may truly discount the risks of smoking, but this is where they are. Motivational interviewing explores the benefits and risks with the patient, without judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">Motivational interviewing combines Rogers&#8217;s<sup><a id="ch9-ref7" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref7">7</a></sup> client-centered approach to therapy and more directive or guided approaches for helping people change. The basic idea behind motivational interviewing is that, <a id="page_121"/>for any number of reasons, patients are often ambivalent about or resistant to change. They may not be aware that a change is truly needed. They may have misinterpreted the seriousness of the condition. They may understand the treatment regimen but be unable to carry it out without great difficulty. As a result, they&#8217;re not sure they have what it takes to control their illness. Or, they simply do not want to engage in the behavior change because, for them, the benefits do not outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="indent">When patients are ambivalent, their pros about making the change are equal to their cons. When they are resistant, their cons outweigh the pros. Ambivalence affects readiness to change and inhibits the adoption of strategies for change. Motivational interviewing starts with an assessment of patients&#8217; readiness to change, or their pros and cons. Although motivational interviewing does not assess the stage of readiness, it does assess whether the patient is ambivalent, resistant, or ready for change.</p>
<p class="indent">Motivational interviewing is extremely useful because it teaches the health care provider to explore the patient&#8217;s understanding and concerns. It focuses on dealing with resistance and helping patients move toward readiness. In motivational interviewing, the health care provider views resistance as information&#8212;as a sign of a disturbance in rapport between the health care provider and the patient. The health care provider needs to explore the resistance or ambivalence, not try to persuade or manipulate the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, when a patient says, &#8220;I am just not ready to quit smoking,&#8221; he is expressing resistance. A typical response might be to try persuading the patient to quit by saying, &#8220;You have to know that smoking is bad for you. You need to quit.&#8221; The patient might then respond by saying, &#8220;I have too much stress in my life, and smoking relaxes me. I am just not ready to quit.&#8221; In this example, the health care provider has caused the patient to &#8220;lose face&#8221; by shaming the patient&#8217;s judgment (&#8220;you have to know&#8230;&#8220;) and demeaning the patient&#8217;s autonomy (&#8220;You need to quit&#8221;). Naturally, the patient has sought to &#8220;save face&#8221; by affirming why change is not possible. All too often, when health care providers try to persuade patients to change, they cause their patients to lose face and to become even more resistant to change.</p>
<h3 class="h3">MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING AND &#8220;FACE&#8221;</h3>
<p class="noindent">Motivational interviewing helps save face for patients. When patients do not feel that they have to defend themselves, they are more open to engaging in real change talk.</p>
<p class="indent">We all understand how it feels to lose face in moments of extreme embarassment or shame, but it was Goffman<sup><a id="ch9-ref8" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref8">8</a></sup> who first pointed out how much adjusting or &#8220;facework&#8221; we do in everyday talk to avoid loss <a id="page_122"/>of face for ourselves and for other people. Avoiding loss of face for others is more effective than trying to repair their loss of face after the fact. Unfortunately, when health care providers play the role of &#8220;expert&#8221; they sometimes feel they have a warrant to disregard their patients&#8217; need to save face. Consequently, they may &#8220;drag the patient&#8217;s face through the mud&#8221; by talking in a demeaning and judgmental manner. And this doesn&#8217;t have to happen in any heavy-handed way for the patient to feel loss of face and become even more resistant to change. In order to understand this, we need to look more closely at the concept of face.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept refers to the basic human need to look good to other people. We all want to be treated as capable, competent, and independent individuals. When interacting with others, we read between the lines of their comments to gauge how they are viewing us. If their comments imply that they respect our judgments and actions, they have supported our &#8220;face,&#8221; and we feel good and relax. At these times we are open to dialogue about our life, our health choices, and our decisions to change. If, however, people imply that they view us as deficient and incompetent, we lose face and take steps to try to restore it. Such interaction is called defensive facework. It can range from minimizing the importance of the other person&#8217;s concern, to denying their competence, to withdrawing from the interaction. The key point is that whenever a health care provider causes a patient to lose face, the patient becomes defensive and the health care provider loses rapport with the patient. When patients have lost face, they are closed to substantive dialogue about their lives, their health choices, and their decisions to change. Why would a patient ever want to change if a health care provider implies, &#8220;I know what is best for you, and if you don&#8217;t do what I tell you to do you are stupid and incompetent&#8221;?</p>
<p class="indent">Although recent research has suggested that face may have as many as six different aspects,<sup><a id="ch9-ref9" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref9">9</a></sup> the concept has traditionally been characterized as focused on competence and autonomy. The competence aspect relates to how knowledgeable and capable we are. A simple test of a comment&#8217;s potential for causing loss of <em>competence face</em> is whether concluding the comment with &#8220;&#8230;, Stupid&#8221; captures its spirit. The following comments all threaten the competence face of a patient, because they imply lack of knowledge or incompetent decision-making:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that eating lots of pasta will elevate your blood sugar levels?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;Look, smoking causes lung cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;When are you finally going to take this medication properly?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_123"/>In contrast, the wording of the following comments reduces the threat to a patient&#8217;s competence face:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;What&#8217;s your understanding of the types of foods that will cause your blood sugar to go up?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;What are your thoughts about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;How important is it for you to take this medication as prescribed?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><em>Autonomy face</em> relates to respecting the independence of the patient. Any comment that tells the patient what to do threatens the patient&#8217;s autonomy face. The following are examples of such comments:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;You&#8217;re just going to have to give up eating all those doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to start monitoring your blood sugar levels and exercising every day.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;You need to quit smoking.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt">In contrast, the following comments respect patients&#8217; autonomy and right to make their own decisions:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;How ready are you to give up or cut back on eating doughnuts?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;Monitoring your blood sugar levels and exercising are two way to further reduce your blood sugar. Which of these two options do you think would be most helpful for you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;What would make you consider quitting smoking?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt">Learning to rephrase what we say to patients can significantly reduce the threat to their competence and autonomy face, but there are more subtle aspects of being an &#8220;expert&#8221; that also threaten patients&#8217; face. Motivational interviewing advocates changing some of the basic strategies we use in counseling patients.</p>
<p class="indent">All too often, health care providers presume to know what the patient&#8217;s life is like and, consequently, feel entitled to make judgments about the patient&#8217;s best treatment option. For example, if a patient says that she is missing doses of her medication, the health care provider may assume this is a memory problem and immediately begin discussing <a id="page_124"/>types of containers that could help her remember to take her medication. Such an approach is very demeaning if the patient&#8217;s real problem is that she does not see the need to take the medication every day or is not able to afford it. Presuming to know the patient&#8217;s problem can also cause the provider to waste time discussing containers the patient does not need. Motivational interviewing stresses exploring the patient&#8217;s problems instead of presuming to know them. If a patient says she is missing doses, motivational interviewing would involve saying something like &#8220;Tell me more about how you miss taking doses.&#8221; The health care provider would then summarize the problem from the patient&#8217;s perspective: &#8220;So it&#8217;s not so much a matter of forgetting to take these doses as of not seeing the need to take your medication every day.&#8221; Such an approach helps affirm that the provider is listening very carefully to the patient and that the provider and patient are working together as a team to identify and solve the problem. This approach considerably reduces the threat to the patient&#8217;s competence and autonomy face.</p>
<p class="indent">Another subtle strategic change consistent with motivational interviewing involves the manner in which patient education is provided. When a health care provider launches directly into an explanation of information the patient needs, competence face is threatened. The threat can be softened by a request for the patient&#8217;s permission to share the information: &#8220;Would you mind if I share some additional information with you about how exercise affects osteoporosis?&#8221; Patients will give their permission 99&#37; of the time, and they will also feel respected. Asking permission to share information affirms the patient&#8217;s competence face.</p>
<p class="indent">When new information has been shared with the patient, another threat to face can occur if the health care provider tells the patient what conclusion to draw: &#8220;So, this is why you need to exercise more if you want to control your osteoporosis.&#8221; This statement threatens the patient&#8217;s face in two ways. First, it implies that the patient is not capable of making her own assessment of what the information means. Second, it implies that the patient has no choice about what to conclude if she really understands the information. Instead of specifying the proper conclusion to be drawn from new information, a motivational interviewing approach might be to ask, &#8220;So, how do you see this information relating to your situation?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">One final strategy for avoiding threats to a patient&#8217;s autonomy face is to give the patient options. For example, if a patient&#8217;s cholesterol level remains relatively high after he has started taking a statin, the health care provider might say, &#8220;There are three major ways to achieve your goal of reducing your cholesterol levels even more. One way would be to take your statin every day as prescribed. Another way would be to <a id="page_125"/>cut down on the amount of fat in your diet. And a final way would be to exercise more. Which of these do you think would work best for you?&#8221; Providing options preserves the patient&#8217;s autonomy face and offers an opportunity to gain verbal commitment from the patient.</p>
<h3 class="h3">EXPLORING AMBIVALENCE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Motivational interviewing seeks to affirm the competence and autonomy face of the patient. Remembering to affirm the patient&#8217;s face helps clarify how to deal with the decisional balance. If we try to persuade patients who are ambivalent about or resistant to a change, we threaten their face and thereby force them to defend their reasons for not making the change. Patients have pros and cons about change, and telling the pros to patients who are not ready forces them to tell you the cons. A better strategy is to explore the patient&#8217;s ambivalence or resistance by asking open-ended questions, such as &#8220;What would you see as the benefits of quitting smoking?&#8221; or &#8220;What would have to change for you to consider quitting&#8221;? or &#8220;What would make quitting important to you?&#8221; All of these questions explore the patient&#8217;s ambivalence or resistance and allow him to express his reasons for not quitting. They do not force the patient to defend his face. The principle, then, is this: when faced with ambivalence or resistance, <em>explore</em>, don&#8217;t explain.</p>
<p class="indent">A patient may reveal resistance or ambivalence in the form of anger, arguing, ignoring, or interrupting. These are signals to the health care provider to explore what is happening with the patient, not to shame or blame. For example, during a discussion about why a patient needs to lose weight, the patient interrupts three times and indicates that she can&#8217;t do what is being asked. The health care provider, irritated, says, &#8220;You&#8217;ve interrupted me three times. Do you want to learn how to lose weight or not?&#8221; This health care provider did not recognize the disturbance in rapport. Rather than exploring the patient&#8217;s ambivalence, he cut off the chance for a productive interchange. Confronting and exploring the resistance would be more useful. Here is an example: &#8220;Mrs. Jones, I noticed that you interrupt me when I talk to you about losing weight. I wonder if I&#8217;ve said something that you don&#8217;t like or that you&#8217;re uncomfortable about. Tell me more about this.&#8221; The health care provider does not ignore the interruptions. He takes responsibility, does not blame the patient, and explores the source of resistance. Here&#8217;s another example: The patient angrily states, &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s easy for you to tell me to take all of this medicine. You don&#8217;t have to do it!&#8221; A motivational interviewing response would be &#8220;I can sense how frustrated you are about taking all of this medicine. You&#8217;re right&#8212;it&#8217;s a lot easier for me to tell you what to do than it is to actually do it. What do you think might make it easier for you to take your medicines?&#8221; Again, the health care <a id="page_126"/>provider acknowledges the patient&#8217;s frustration, yet responds with empathy and explores the patient&#8217;s concerns. What would happen if the patient answered the question with &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what would make it easier&#8221;? In that case the health care provider would ask permission to give advice by saying, &#8220;May I tell you what other patients have tried?&#8221; If the patient says yes, then the health care provider would offer suggestions and ask, &#8220;Do any of these seem like something you&#8217;d want to try?&#8221; The key is respecting the patient&#8217;s autonomy and exploring the problem from the patient&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<h3 class="h3">EXAMPLE OF MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING</h3>
<p class="noindent">The primary purposes of motivational interviewing are to reflect back our understanding of the patient (especially the emotional components of what the patient expresses) and to identify any motivational issues that may enhance target behaviors (such as taking medicine or losing weight) or impede motivation for change. In the following example, the pharmacist&#8217;s responses illustrate these two important purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">Mary Brooks, a 57-year-old Caucasian woman, has been diagnosed with osteoporosis. Her DEXA T-score is &#8211;2.8 (a negative score of 2.5 or more indicates osteoporosis). She has been prescribed a once-weekly bisphosphonate to treat her osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates must be taken on an empty stomach with a full glass of water at least 30 minutes before eating in the morning. Taking this medication with food can cause serious heartburn or reflux. To prevent erosion of the esophagus, the patient is to remain upright immediately after taking the medicine.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Brooks is 3 weeks late getting her prescription (a 1-month supply) refilled. The pharmacist inquires whether she has been having any trouble remembering to take the medicine.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Mrs. Brooks: Look, I don&#8217;t know anything about what that DEXA score means. They tell me I have problems with my bones. I feel just fine. Then when I take this medicine, I get terrible heartburn, so I just don&#8217;t like to take it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: So, if I understand you correctly, you have some doubts about having problems with your bones. And you feel OK, but when you take the medicine you get terrible heartburn, so you wonder, &#8220;Why in the world would I want to take something that makes me feel so bad when I am not even sure I have a problem?&#8221; (reflecting back understanding)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: My thoughts exactly!</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_127"/>Pharmacist: Mrs. Brooks, I do have your DEXA T-score here. If I might, I could give you some information that would explain what it means about your bone problems and also tell you how to take the medicine so that you don&#8217;t get any heartburn. Would that be OK? (asking permission to use education to address the patient&#8217;s two motivational issues: Do I have a bone problem? and I don&#8217;t want to take medicine that may be unnecessary that gives me heartburn)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Sure. That would be fine.</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist would provide the necessary information and then reassess where the patient is in regard to her osteoporosis and taking the bisphosphonate. Notice that it is because of the pharmacist&#8217;s empathy and understanding that the patient is willing to receive additional information. Too often, health care providers want to jump right in and give information without first establishing that they understand the patient&#8217;s perspective. Another trap that pharmacists and other health care providers might fall into here is to respond to the patient&#8217;s complaint with &#8220;Did someone tell you how to take this medicine properly?&#8221; or &#8220;You probably aren&#8217;t taking this medicine correctly.&#8221; Neither of these responses is useful or appropriate. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the patient was told how to take the medicine properly. It is obvious from her complaint that she is not taking it properly. Either response is likely to embarrass the patient or cause defensiveness. Neither response builds the relationship.</p>
<h3 class="h3">STRATEGIES FOR MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Motivational interviewing focuses on a menu of interview strategies and five supporting principles for identifying the patient&#8217;s readiness to engage in the target behaviors and assisting in change. The five principles are as follows: express empathy, develop discrepancy, avoid argumentation, roll with resistance, and support self-efficacy. The menu of strategies is modified from the work of Rollnick and colleagues.<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref6">6</a></sup> In no more than 5 to 15 minutes, a skilled provider can use the entire menu of interview strategies with a patient who has a new diagnosis and medication. Subsequent visits will not require use of the entire menu and should take only 3 to 5 minutes. An individual patient may require some or all of the items, depending on where the patient is in the process. Each time the patient is seen, some or all of the strategies will be used. All of the skills or strategies used in motivational interviewing are designed to do one of three things: (1) follow the patient (demonstrate empathy and understanding), (2) inform the patient (by <a id="page_128"/>asking permission, as in the osteoporosis example), or (3) guide the patient (with an emphasis on choice; e.g., &#8220;There are three things you can do to lower your blood pressure: Take your medicine as prescribed, exercise, and make dietary changes. Which would you like to work on first?&#8221;).<sup><a id="ch9-ref10" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref10">10</a></sup> Skills for using these strategies are discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>1. Opening strategy: lifestyle.</strong> This strategy involves talking in general about the patient&#8217;s lifestyle from the patient&#8217;s own perspective. Does the patient view it as healthy or unhealthy? What does he like or dislike about it? Are there aspects that need to change? Does he see his lifestyle as active or sedentary? Does he exercise? How much? What are his dietary habits? This opening strategy gives the pharmacist a general picture of the patient&#8217;s health habits (or lack of them) and desire to change unhealthy habits or take on new behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>2. A typical day.</strong> This strategy helps the pharmacist at several levels. Knowing what a typical day is like for the patient allows the pharmacist to do a better job of realistically tailoring medication regimens (or exercise or other factors) to fit the patient&#8217;s daily routines. Tailoring can greatly improve treatment adherence, because patients can attach medication taking to a behavior or activity they are used to doing. Also, knowing how the patient&#8217;s day is structured can help in planning. There is no point in telling a patient to monitor her blood glucose at 3 pm when that is a busy time for her each day. This strategy also helps to build rapport with the patient. It allows the patient to talk about something familiar and comfortable.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>3. The good things and the less good things.</strong> This strategy helps the pharmacist continue to build rapport and allows exploration of how a patient represents his or her illness and its treatment. Patients with misconceptions about an illness or its treatment may treat the illness inappropriately. By asking patients questions such as &#8220;What does having diabetes mean to you?&#8221; and &#8220;What does taking insulin mean to you?&#8221; the pharmacist is able to determine which beliefs are accurate and which need to be corrected. In discussing the good things and the less good things, the pharmacist can also ask patients about what they perceive as barriers and facilitators to treating their illness. What do patients see as the benefits of following the prescribed regimen? Remember that for behavior change to occur, it is vital for patients to believe the pros of a change outweigh the cons. So the patient needs to know what the pros or benefits are and how to reduce the barriers. If you ask the patient, &#8220;What do you see as the benefits of getting your diabetes under control?&#8221; and the patient says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; you can respond with &#8220;May I tell you what I see as the benefits?&#8221; or &#8220;May I tell you what benefits other patients have found?&#8221; Asking permission <a id="page_129"/>promotes patient autonomy and respect. Similarly, if the patient names a barrier, you would ask, &#8220;What are your thoughts on how you might overcome that?&#8221; If the patient doesn&#8217;t know, you would reply, &#8220;May I tell you how other patients have handled that?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">All of this gives the pharmacist the opportunity to listen to the patient and demonstrate understanding by responding empathically. Identifying barriers to and facilitators of behavior change also allows the pharmacist to more accurately determine the patient&#8217;s stage of readiness. Barriers to change are much more prominent in the earlier stages. Finally, knowing the good things and the less good things gives the pharmacist the opportunity to develop discrepancies between old, unwanted behaviors and new, desired behaviors. This is an effective skill for moving patients forward (more on this later).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>4. Providing information.</strong> This strategy is really aimed at <em>exchanging</em> further information. This is where the patient counseling checklist (<a href="chapter5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>) fits into the process. First, the pharmacist should ask if the patient wants additional information about the illness and its treatment (or about smoking cessation or some other topic). If the patient is not ready for more information, it is wise to note this and provide only a leaflet. It does not make sense to try to tell patients more when they are not ready to hear it. If the patient is ready for additional information, it should be provided in an unbiased, nonjudgmental manner. The information provided should assist patients in taking their medications appropriately. Patients should leave the pharmacy with a clear understanding of what to expect and what to do if the expected doesn&#8217;t occur. (For a thorough discussion of the kind of information to be provided, see <a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>5. The future and the present.</strong> This strategy allows patients to discuss what they want to have happen as a result of treating the illness. Usually, any concern or dissatisfaction on the part of the patient will come out here and should be addressed in a compassionate, nonjudgmental manner. Moreover, as patients are given new information, they may have new concerns that need to be discussed.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>6. Helping with decision-making</strong>. Finally, the pharmacist should assist patients in making decisions about managing their illnesses. Patients should be asked questions like &#8220;What are your thoughts about managing your diabetes?&#8221; or &#8220;Where does this leave you now?&#8221;<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref2">2</a></sup> These are neutral, nonjudgmental questions. It is important for the pharmacist to be very patient during this time of questioning. Patients may vacillate between changing and staying the same.</p>
<p class="indent">This process is called elicit&#8211;provide&#8211;elicit. In the first steps, we elicit information from the patient. Next, we provide information. Then we elicit further information from the patient during the discussion. <a id="page_130"/>We do this to make sure that any concerns raised by the new information are addressed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PRINCIPLES OF MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING</h3>
<p class="noindent">The five principles<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref5">5</a></sup> that are used with the menu of strategies, and a rationale for each principle, are discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Express empathy.</strong> Practitioners who are judgmental or impatient or perceive the patient as lazy or uncooperative are likely to fail in assisting a patient with change. The pharmacist who sees the patient as one who is struggling with the process of change and respects the patient and the struggle will be far more successful. The motivational interviewing process is a way of being with the patient. A pharmacist who sees the patient as an object (see <a href="chapter3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>) cannot effectively use motivational interviewing. The process requires seeing the patient as a person. When a patient with high blood pressure says, &#8220;I am just not ready to quit smoking,&#8221; it is condescending to think, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he know this is for his own good? What&#8217;s wrong with him?&#8221; Using motivational interviewing, we instead see it as sad or tragic that the patient continues to jeopardize his health by smoking, and we respond, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound like you are ready to quit smoking. It&#8217;s your decision, but that concerns me because of the increased risk of stroke or heart attack. What would have to happen for you to even consider quitting?&#8221; This response is caring, and it leaves the decision to the patient yet explores the resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">What you are observing with a patient who seems uncooperative, uninterested, or resistant is that patient&#8217;s way of coping with the situation. It may not be productive, but it is the only way the patient knows how to cope at the time. One role of the health care provider is to identify and understand the reasons for resistance from the patient&#8217;s perspective. Only then can other, more productive ways of coping be identified. The tools successful therapists use to initially assess a patient are open-ended questions, reflective listening, and empathic responding, as described in <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Develop discrepancy.</strong> Because patients are often ambivalent about change, initiatives must be taken to begin guiding the patient in the direction of the desired change. Although persuasive strategies may work very well for patients in the later stages of change, they fail miserably when patients are ambivalent or resistant. Usually, persuasive strategies are met with resistance in these early stages. So, what to do? It has already been suggested that expressing empathy and exploring the ambivalence or resistance are critical early on. The next step is to develop discrepancies between a patient&#8217;s present behavior and the behaviors desired. People are much more highly motivated to change when discrepancies exist between current behavior and desired personal goals.<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_131"/>To develop discrepancy, ask patients about the good things and the less good things associated with their present behaviors and the changes that are needed. For example, if the patient says, &#8220;I know I should lose some weight, but I have never been any good at that,&#8221; the pharmacist could respond, &#8220;What do you see as the benefits of losing weight? What do you think will get in your way?&#8221; After listening carefully, the pharmacist would repeat back his understanding of the benefits and downsides. For example, he might say, &#8220;So, on the one hand, you realize that if you lost weight, you would feel better, probably lower your blood pressure, and in general, be healthier. On the other hand, you haven&#8217;t been successful at permanently losing weight, and you would have to give up too many foods that you like. What do you make of these different ways of looking at it?&#8221; The pharmacist allows the patient to see the discrepancies in the information presented. He might add, &#8220;The decision to lose weight is yours. I believe we could find foods you would enjoy that are lower in fat and calories. If you do decide to lose weight and reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack, please let me know. I&#8217;d like to help.&#8221; This reinforces the patient&#8217;s autonomy yet creates dissonance by reintroducing the risks and concerns in a nonjudgmental manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Another way to develop discrepancy is through the use of goals. For example, you have established that a patient with high blood pressure has a goal of reducing his risk of stroke or heart attack, yet he continues to smoke. Developing discrepancy would sound like this: &#8220;So, on the one hand you have an excellent goal of reducing your risk of stroke or heart attack by taking your medicine. On the other hand, smoking increases your risk of stroke or heart attack by raising your blood pressure. What are your thoughts about this?&#8221; Our objective here is to simply get the patient to start thinking about the conflict between his goal and his smoking.</p>
<p class="indent">Motivational interviewing attempts to create these discrepancies without making the patient feel threatened or pressured. Through effective questioning, the skilled interviewer attempts to identify existing discrepancies. If this is done properly, the patient will come up with reasons the change is necessary.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Avoid argumentation.</strong> As stated by Miller and Rollnick,<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref5">5</a></sup> &#8220;Motivational interviewing is confrontational in its purpose: to increase awareness of problems and the need to do something about them.&#8221; However, this kind of confrontation is different from arguing with the patient, trying to convince patients they have a problem when they are not ready to accept it, or labeling patients (e.g., overweight, diabetic, hypertensive, anorexic, uncooperative) in order to promote change. Arguing tends to increase resistance rather than increasing motivation to change.<sup><a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_132"/>When a patient states, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t think this medicine works,&#8221; a pharmacist using motivational interviewing responds, &#8220;You have doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine. What would you need to know? What information would make you feel more confident that the medicine is working? What&#8217;s causing you to have doubts?&#8221; This response respects the patient and explores her doubts.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Roll with resistance.</strong> When dealing with patients who do not want to change, are overwhelmed, or won&#8217;t take their illnesses seriously, there is a tendency to become frustrated or angry. This frustration or anger often leads to heightened attempts to persuade patients that they have a problem, that they should take it seriously, and that they should make a more committed effort to adhere to the instructions (to &#8220;get with the program&#8221;). When patients make statements that indicate resistance (&#8220;But I just can&#8217;t remember to take it three times a day,&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s easy for you to say. You don&#8217;t have high blood pressure,&#8221; &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand what the big deal is. I feel fine&#8221;), they are providing valuable insight into where the problems lie. For example, a less complicated regimen, identification of low-salt foods, or clarification of information may be a solution to the identified problem. Nonetheless, as stated previously, communication that expresses understanding of the problems the patient encounters will go much further than browbeating or arguing. Ultimately, it will be the patient&#8217;s job (with your support and assistance) to solve the problems presented. You may be able to decrease the complexity of the regimen, but the patient will still have to take the medication. You may be able to suggest foods that are low in sodium, but the patient will still have to avoid high-sodium foods.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Support self-efficacy.</strong> Patients have to believe they have the knowledge and skills or abilities to carry out the treatment plan. The pharmacist can help the patient develop self-efficacy about carrying out the treatment plan in various ways:<sup><a id="ch9-ref11" href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9_ref11">11</a></sup> (1) by providing and clarifying information; (2) by offering realistic hope and expressing confidence in the patient&#8217;s ability to succeed; (3) by noticing successful attempts at adherence, even if they are short-lived; (4) by praising ideas that the patient comes up with to solve problems; and (5) by continuing to emphasize and support the responsibilities that both the patient and the provider have in improving treatment adherence and treatment outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">The pharmacist should not underestimate how powerful it is to support the patient&#8217;s efforts at moving toward the target behavior. This includes both actions and thoughts. For example, on Mrs. Jones&#8217;s first visit you asked whether she smoked. She said yes, and you asked if she&#8217;d considered quitting. She said she had no desire to quit: &#8220;Yes, I know all about the warnings about smoking, so spare me the lecture.&#8221; The next time Mrs. Jones came in, she said to the pharmacist, &#8220;I&#8217;ve <a id="page_133"/>given some thought to what you said about my smoking and my high blood pressure.&#8221; Even though she may still not be ready to quit, this statement indicates movement and should be noticed. The pharmacist could say, &#8220;Great. What has you thinking more about quitting?&#8221; Then the pharmacist should listen carefully, reflect back his understanding, and praise the patient&#8217;s thoughts about quitting: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that you&#8217;ve been thinking about this. What you&#8217;re saying makes a lot of sense.&#8221; Then he could say, &#8220;What would have to happen for you to be more serious about quitting?&#8221; Note that this patient is not ready to consider a smoking cessation patch or other nicotine replacement therapy. That is simply too much movement for now.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let&#8217;s take a look at a dialogue that shows how we can apply what has been discussed in this chapter. The pharmacist has been trained in motivational interviewing, and the patient, Mrs. Jones, is having a difficult time accepting that she has asthma. Mrs. Jones has brought in several prescriptions.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Mrs. Jones: Here. (quite dejectedly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You seem a little down today, Mrs. Jones. (expressing empathy)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Well, look at these prescriptions.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Looks like you have asthma.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: So now you know why I&#8217;m so down.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You are down because you just found out and it came unexpectedly. (expressing empathy)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Well, yes. I mean, I get winded sometimes, but I didn&#8217;t know I had asthma.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Asthma sounds bad to you. (expressing empathy and identifying a motivational issue)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Sure. You have to take medicine for it. I have to stop smoking. I found out my cat&#8217;s hair might be a problem. That doesn&#8217;t sound bad to you? (elaborating further on her motivational issues)</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_134"/>Pharmacist: It sounds like a lot of change at one time. (expressing empathy and avoiding argumentation)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: You&#8217;re darn right. I might quit smoking, but I&#8217;ve had my little Chubbers for 7 years and I&#8217;m not giving her up. I love that cat.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It sounds like you have a lot of difficult decisions to make. (expressing empathy) What did the doctor tell you about asthma?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Not much. He just said that I need to use these medicines, stop smoking, and get rid of the cat. He&#8217;s got some nerve&#8212;get rid of the cat!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You didn&#8217;t like his advice. (expressing empathy, rolling with resistance, and avoiding argumentation)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Not one bit.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know that you don&#8217;t want to get rid of Chubbers. What do you think about quitting smoking? (exploring motivational issues with the patient)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: I don&#8217;t know. It relaxes me a lot, but Dr. Carroll says it&#8217;s bad for my asthma. Is that true?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Smoking does cause asthma to get worse. It does increase your risks associated with asthma. What do you think about that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: That&#8217;s what Dr. Carroll said, too. I guess it&#8217;s true. I don&#8217;t want that.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: So, on the one hand you&#8217;re telling me that smoking relaxes you, but you also seem to be saying that you realize smoking will make your asthma worse. (developing discrepancy)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Yeah, I guess so. I need to go home and sort all of this out. Just fill my prescriptions.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It all seems somewhat overwhelming right now. (expressing empathy)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Yes.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I&#8217;ll get these prescriptions filled and then we&#8217;ll talk about how to use them properly so you&#8217;ll get the most benefit from them.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_135"/>Mrs. Jones: All right.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Has Dr. Carroll talked to you about a peak flow meter?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: A what?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: A peak flow meter to tell how your breathing is doing.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Look, I can&#8217;t handle anything else right now. Could you just get my prescriptions filled?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Sure, we can talk about the peak flow meter another time. (rolling with resistance, expressing empathy)</p>
<p class="indentt">It seems clear from this dialogue that Mrs. Jones is not ready to accept her asthma and the things she may need to do to get it under control. The pharmacist is patient and caring and does not try to push the patient too fast. The pharmacist does not insist on talking to the patient about peak flow because she is not ready to hear about this yet. She is ambivalent about what to do and needs some time to sort things out. The pharmacist uses many of the principles of motivational interviewing in this dialogue. Even though not everything got covered and not every strategy on the menu was used, no bridges were burned and no added resistance occurred, because the pharmacist did not rush things. The pharmacist realized that this is a process and that other opportunities to talk to Mrs. Jones about her asthma would occur.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Motivational interviewing and the stages of change are useful concepts and processes for meeting patients where they are in their readiness to manage their illnesses. They provide strategies for assisting patients with change. They require that pharmacists see their job as serving the needs of the patient, not vice versa. They require that pharmacists care about their patients and respect their autonomy. When this can be done, better outcomes are more likely to occur.</p>
