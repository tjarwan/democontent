<h2 class="h2a"><em>CHOOSING TO SEE<br/>PATIENTS AS PEOPLE</em></h2>
<p class="chapauthor">Bruce A. Berger and Robert E. Smith</p>
<p class="noindent">When we encounter patients, we can see them as people with a wide range of feelings, hopes, aspirations, strengths and weaknesses (the responsive way). Or we can see them as irrelevant, unimportant, or unworthy of our help&#8212;as objects that can hinder us or can help us accomplish our own goals (the resistant way). Our choice of the responsive way or the resistant way determines how we see other people and how we act toward them. This chapter uses a &#8220;pharmacy fable&#8221; to explore the impact of our chosen way of being on patient care.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><em>Hank, a pharmacy manager, sets the stage: I didn&#8217;t even see her coming. I was so busy filling prescriptions, answering the phone, and checking the technician&#8217;s work that I didn&#8217;t notice her. Mrs. Knoll, 60 years old, always complains and is always grumpy. No one likes to wait on her. We cringe when she comes in. There is always something wrong. I knew she was there without even looking up. I could hear that voice, like nails on a chalkboard. This time Emily, the pharmacist I just hired, is about to feel her wrath. I just hope Emily doesn&#8217;t quit</em>.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Emily: Hello. May I help you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: (angrily tossing her new prescription on the counter) I don&#8217;t know. It depends. How long&#8217;s this gonna take? And who are you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I&#8217;m a new pharmacist here, Emily Harris. Nice to meet you. (extends hand) I just came in, so let me see how long it will take.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_34"/>Mrs. Knoll: Don&#8217;t bother. I see him back there. Hey, Hank, how long are you going to make me wait this time before you take half my money?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I have three people ahead of you, so it will be about 20 minutes. What&#8217;s wrong today?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: What do you care? All you want to do is take my money. Twenty minutes to throw a few pills in a bottle&#8212;that&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Would you like to have a seat while we fill your prescription?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: What for? If I sit down, he&#8217;ll probably take longer. So what are <em>you</em> gonna do here? Cause Hank to charge me even more?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Actually, Hank hired me to help patients manage chronic illnesses like diabetes, asthma, and high blood pressure. I noticed that your medicine is for high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: So, what&#8217;s it to you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Did you just find out you have high blood pressure?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Are you gonna ask me about my life history or are you gonna fill my prescription?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Let me give this to Hank to fill. If it&#8217;s OK with you, I&#8217;d like to talk to you about your medicine while he fills the prescription. (hands prescription to Hank, who rolls his eyes)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: What for? (indignantly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Did you just find out you have high blood pressure?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: No! You really are new, aren&#8217;t you? I had a water pill, and the doctor said it wasn&#8217;t doing enough to control my blood pressure, so he gave me this stuff today. Isn&#8217;t that just wonderful? (sarcastically)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I know you must have been disappointed to find out your blood pressure was up.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Scared the heck out of me. I don&#8217;t want to have a stroke, for goodness sake.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I don&#8217;t want that either.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_35"/>Mrs. Knoll: Why? So you won&#8217;t be able to get my money?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Mrs. Knoll, it is really important to me that my patients do as well as possible on their medicines. I don&#8217;t want anything to happen to you, and I don&#8217;t want you taking medicine that isn&#8217;t helping. I would rather have you take less medicine and pay less money, if that&#8217;s what is needed.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Yeah, right.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Let me tell you something about this new medicine Dr. Braun is giving you. It&#8217;s called a&#8230;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: (interrupts) Just put one of those leaflets in the bag when he&#8217;s done. I&#8217;ll read about it, and if I have any questions, I&#8217;ll call.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: As I said, Mrs. Knoll, I want to make sure you get the most benefit from your medicine. I don&#8217;t mind taking some time now.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: That&#8217;s OK. Just put the leaflet in the bag.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: OK, please do call if you have any questions. Hank should have your medicine for you in a few minutes. By the way, Mrs. Knoll, do you have your blood pressure checked regularly?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Every 6 months at the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I&#8217;d like you to consider getting it checked more often. It&#8217;s the only way you can be sure your medicine is working properly. We have blood pressure cuffs that I can show you how to use, or we can check your blood pressure here in the pharmacy as often as you want. We would send the readings to your doctor every 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Hank has trained you well. (says this loudly enough for Hank to hear) Just another ploy to get my money.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I&#8217;m sorry you thought that was what I was doing. I really think it&#8217;s important for my patients to regularly monitor their blood pressure, and I hope you will consider it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Sure, sweetie. (condescendingly) Just tell Hank to get me my medicine.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I sure will. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Knoll. You have a good day.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Knoll: Sure. (rolling eyes)</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_36"/><em>After a few minutes, Hank hands Mrs. Knoll her medicine, and she complains about the co-payment and then leaves. Hank goes back to the pharmacy and talks to Emily:</em></p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I don&#8217;t get you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: What do you mean?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Why were you so nice to her? She certainly wasn&#8217;t nice to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: So, you think that I should be kind and caring only to the people who are nice to me?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Well, not exactly, but she&#8217;s just such a grump!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: She doesn&#8217;t trust people. That&#8217;s sad.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Huh? Sad? It&#8217;s downright infuriating. What did I ever do to her?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I don&#8217;t know. Since I just met her, I know I didn&#8217;t do anything, and still she mistrusted me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Doesn&#8217;t that bother you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: It makes me feel sad. It must be a horrible feeling to believe no one can be trusted.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: It irritates the heck out of me. I didn&#8217;t do anything to her. All I&#8217;ve ever done is try to help, and she gripes about everything.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: So you feel attacked.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Darn right. I don&#8217;t understand why you don&#8217;t feel attacked.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I know her response has nothing to do with me. I don&#8217;t want to be a victim, walking around and being angry or upset just because other people are that way.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: So, are you saying I&#8217;m a victim?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Hank, here&#8217;s what I know. I read a remarkable book called <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em><sup><a id="ch3-ref1" href="chapter3.xhtml#ch3_ref1">1</a></sup> by the Arbinger Institute. I was so taken by what it had to say that I went back and read another book, <em>Bonds That Make Us Free</em>,<sup><a id="ch3-ref2" href="chapter3.xhtml#ch3_ref2">2</a></sup> by Arbinger&#8217;s founder, C. Terry Warner. <a id="page_37"/>These books have changed the way I see the world. In a nutshell, here&#8217;s what they say. We can choose either of two ways to respond to people. Arbinger calls them the responsive way and the resistant way. In the responsive way, we see people as people. We are open and responsive to their concerns. We see their pain, their disappointment, their joy, their happiness&#8230;even their mistrust. In the resistant way, we see people as objects. We resist their reality. We see them as less important, less relevant, less real, or a threat&#8212;if we see them at all. In the resistant way, people are irrelevant or they are obstacles (a threat to us) or vehicles (someone to do our bidding). In this way of being, we are focused on ourselves and don&#8217;t really see the other person.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Are you saying that, with Mrs. Knoll, I&#8217;m in the resistant way?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I&#8217;ll let you think about that, Hank. The point is that we choose our way of being. Our way of being goes deeper than how we behave outwardly. Can I tell you more?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Yes, you&#8217;ve got me interested&#8212;skeptical, but interested.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Drawing on the work of the philosopher Martin Buber,<sup><a id="ch3-ref3" href="chapter3.xhtml#ch3_ref3">3</a></sup> Warner and the Arbinger Institute say that we are always in relationship with people. Who we are, our &#8220;I,&#8221; is not a separate &#8220;I.&#8221; It is an &#8220;I&#8221; always in relationship to others.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: You just lost me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: See if this helps. When we are in the responsive way of being, we relate to people in the way Buber called I&#8211;thou, or I&#8211;you. In the resistant way, we relate as I&#8211;it. The other person is no longer real to us, no longer a person. For this to happen, we have to become blind to the reality that even though we may not like the way they are acting, people are still people, not objects.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I think I see what you mean. We are always in relationship and always choosing our way of being, which determines how we see another person. People really aren&#8217;t objects; it&#8217;s just how we see them.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Exactly! Here&#8217;s a question for you, Hank: When is a person not a person?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Is this a trick question, Emily? A person is always a person.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_38"/>Emily: Right! Despite the fact that people are always people, they can become objects to us. But, in truth, do they become objects?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: This is getting deep. But, no&#8212;that&#8217;s just how we see them.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Exactly! It&#8217;s how <em>we</em> see them. They did not cease being people. We may not like what they do. They may not do what we want them to do. They may not seem important at the moment. But they are still people.&#8230; Hank, you look a little pale.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I&#8217;m a little stunned. I think you&#8217;re saying that the problem with Mrs. Knoll was my way of being and my refusal to see her as a person.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: That&#8217;s very insightful, Hank. Warner and Arbinger call this self-betrayal or self-deception. It is what happens when we don&#8217;t do what we know is right or when we do something other than what we know to be right. We betray ourselves. It also happens when we don&#8217;t even know we have a problem.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: You just lost me. What does that have to do with seeing Mrs. Knoll as a person or as an object?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: OK, let&#8217;s try this. You will agree with me that Mrs. Knoll, no matter what you think about her, <em>is</em> a person.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Yes.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Yet, as soon as you saw her&#8230;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: OK, OK. Go on.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: What was it that caused you to stop seeing her as a person?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: It&#8217;s the way she acts.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Let me add one more piece of information. When we betray ourselves or deceive ourselves, we always justify our actions. We have to justify to ourselves why we did what we did. We say, how am I supposed to act toward someone who is so rude, so negative, someone who complains all the time? We usually exaggerate our strengths and overemphasize the other person&#8217;s weaknesses. These thoughts justify our own feelings about the other person and explain to us why we acted as we did.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: But, she <em>is</em> rude and she <em>does</em> complain all the time.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_39"/>Emily: So?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: What do you mean, so? So, that&#8217;s why I see her that way. Wait a minute. Are you implying that in some way I betrayed myself and then justified it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: What do you think, Hank?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: You tell me. I don&#8217;t know&#8230; maybe.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Since Mrs. Knoll is a person, even if she complains a lot, what do you think is the right way to treat her?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: (sheepishly) I guess, to love her anyway, turn the other cheek, all that stuff. Be nice to her anyway.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Hank, you really are trying. I appreciate your willingness to struggle with this. OK, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. Mrs. Knoll, the person, comes in, and because of your history with her (and her present way) you respond in the resistant way. You don&#8217;t see her as a person, and you can&#8217;t see her pain and her discomfort with life in general. You react to her rudeness and negativity as if she is the problem, and then you justify your self-betrayal in not treating her in a caring way. This self-justification further blinds you to the truth.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: What truth?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: That she is a person, that how she acts has nothing to do with you, and that your way of being is the cause of the problem.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: So, it&#8217;s all my fault, huh? She&#8217;s mean-spirited, and it&#8217;s my fault!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: It&#8217;s not a matter of fault. It&#8217;s a matter of choice. Your way of being is a matter of personal responsibility, and it determines how you respond to any person.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Can I see whether I understand what you&#8217;re saying?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Sure.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: OK, it&#8217;s my feeling victimized that causes me to choose the resistant way of being and betray myself by not treating Mrs. Knoll as a person. Then, I justify my actions by blaming it on the way she treated me, and all this leads to my not seeing her or to my own betrayal.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_40"/>Emily: That&#8217;s terrific. That&#8217;s exactly it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: And you treated her well because you were in the responsive way of being from the start.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I&#8217;d like to think so.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: OK, I&#8217;m ready for more.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: According to Arbinger, the resistant way is also called being &#8220;in the box.&#8221; When we&#8217;re in the box we cannot see people as people. We get in the box through self-betrayal or acting in a resistant way toward another person. The interesting thing is that people can carry these boxes around with them. We can develop them in childhood. Many people have very large boxes. In the box, we have self-justifying images, such as &#8220;I deserve respect, I deserve appreciation, I&#8217;m important, I&#8217;m better, I&#8217;m smarter.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: But don&#8217;t people deserve to be respected?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: My basic belief is that all people should be respected. But a self-justifying image can prevent us from seeing the other person as a person, and then the last thing we&#8217;re likely to do is be respectful. Isn&#8217;t that ironic? When we self-righteously say, &#8220;I deserve respect,&#8221; we are most likely to be disrespectful toward the other person, as if they don&#8217;t deserve respect.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I see what you&#8217;re saying. We respect people when we see them as people, with cares, concerns, problems, anxieties, and joys similar to what we experience.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Exactly, and <em>not</em> because we are using our self-justifying image to explain away our disdain toward someone. Because all of us carry our boxes around, we can be in the box or out of the box in any encounter. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s really interesting: Anything we communicate while we are in the box will either cause more problems or, at best, be viewed as phony. People respond to how we are being and not to what we are doing. Therefore, if we are trying to be understanding but are in the box, people will sense that we&#8217;re not being genuine. Also, because we don&#8217;t see people as people when we&#8217;re in the box or in the resistant way of being, we are likely to say something that will escalate any disagreement or problem we perceive in the conversation, even though we may be trying to do otherwise.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_41"/>Hank: So, all that stuff we sometimes learn about communication being the way to solve problems doesn&#8217;t work when we&#8217;re in the box. It has a chance of working only when we are in the responsive way of being.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: That&#8217;s exactly right, Hank.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: This is really opening my eyes. I want to talk more about this with you, but right now there are people walking toward the pharmacy.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: We can pick this up later. It has serious implications for patient care.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: You have me intrigued.</p>
<p class="indentt">What have we learned so far? Emily is helping Hank learn some important lessons about responsibility, choice, and way of being. Like many of us would, Hank found it easier to blame Mrs. Knoll for the way he acted toward her. He believed that he was not responsible for his actions toward her, that she caused his feelings and actions. Hank is learning from Emily that it is far more difficult, yet more rewarding, to consciously choose to see people as they truly are, with all of their joys, foibles, and struggles. When we cease to see our patients as people, we run the risk of withdrawing care that is necessary for their well-being. This care is part of a covenant we make with patients when we become health care providers.</p>
<p class="indent">Hank saw Mrs. Knoll as one of those cantankerous patients whose visits pharmacists dread. He was amazed at Emily&#8217;s behavior and asked why she was so nice to Mrs. Knoll. Emily and Hank&#8217;s dialogue on relationships is based on the work of the Arbinger Institute, Terry Warner, and Martin Buber. The essence is that our way of being determines how we relate to others. We can choose to see them either as people with cares, concerns, feelings, emotions, desires, dreams, strengths, and weaknesses, or as objects&#8212;individuals who are irrelevant to us, obstacles, or vehicles for getting what we want. Martin Buber described these ways of relating as I&#8211;thou and I&#8211;it. We choose to see others as people or as objects. It is not the other person&#8217;s behavior that establishes how we act toward that person; we are not victims of the behavior of others.</p>
<p class="indent">Let&#8217;s eavesdrop again as Hank and Emily continue their conversation the next day.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Hank: Emily, I really am trying to understand what you&#8217;ve been saying about our way of being, but I&#8217;m having trouble seeing how my behavior toward Mrs. Knoll is not in some way determined <a id="page_42"/>by her actions toward me. She is the worst patient this pharmacy has ever had. I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;m choosing to act the way I do toward her; it&#8217;s almost as if she makes me do it. But the way you explain it makes it sound like I&#8217;m the problem.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Well, could you choose to act in a kind, benevolent manner toward her? And could you do this even if she isn&#8217;t kind?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I suppose I could, but it is so hard because of the way she acts toward me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I know it&#8217;s hard. Do you remember when we talked about being either in or out of the box? If we&#8217;re in the box, we are seeing people as objects. When we&#8217;re out of the box, we are seeing them as people. I often find myself moving in and out of the box in my relationships. I&#8217;m getting better at staying out of the box, but I&#8217;m beginning to recognize when I go into the box with someone, and I work hard at getting out. The real irony is that when we go into the box, things get even harder. A conflict escalates or more feelings get hurt. When dealing with someone who is &#8220;difficult,&#8221; going into the box only exacerbates the difficulty, because we are now contributing to it. Do you see what I mean?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Yes. It&#8217;s just so hard to admit that it&#8217;s my problem or choice, when she treats us this way. I&#8217;ve always tried to be nice to people, but she seems to bring out the worst in me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Hank, I want you to reflect back on the first time you met Mrs. Knoll. Do you remember the first thought you had about her that day?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I think I wanted to help her, and I greeted her kindly.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Did that behavior continue?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: It sure didn&#8217;t. She came at me strong about the price of her medicine, her anticipated wait, and how no one seems to care, and soon I started avoiding her.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Do you remember your reasoning when that began to happen?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Well, at first I kept trying to help her, but after a while I began to think she really didn&#8217;t care about the service. In my mind she was uncaring, angry, impatient, obstinate, unwilling to discuss options, and a very bad patient. I didn&#8217;t want her in the pharmacy, except <a id="page_43"/>perhaps for her money. I didn&#8217;t even want to talk to her. I would have been happy if she&#8217;d gone elsewhere.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: What did you think of yourself?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I didn&#8217;t do anything. I was still the same pharmacist I was before. I&#8217;ve always considered myself a good pharmacist, one who cares about his patients and tries to do what&#8217;s best for them.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Was that what you were still trying to do with Mrs. Knoll?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I guess not. Wait a minute. A light just went on in my head. Are you saying I went into the box with Mrs. Knoll?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: What do you think?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: And perhaps I began to justify my behavior toward Mrs. Knoll. Did I make her out to be worse than she really is, and myself a little better than I actually am?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Could be. Did being in the box about Mrs. Knoll affect the services you provided her?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Perhaps it did. I think I know what made me go into the box. When she complained about our prices and how long she had to wait, I started to feel small, like a kid being scolded. I got defensive. I stopped seeing <em>myself</em> as a person. Then I didn&#8217;t see her, because I was in the box. Her complaining didn&#8217;t mean I did something wrong. I just needed to acknowledge her frustration or understand it, and even if I did do something wrong, all I had to do was acknowledge that. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s even more amazing: When I responded defensively, it reinforced my own sense of being small; that didn&#8217;t help me. If I had responded respectfully, I would have felt better about myself.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Hank, I think you&#8217;re right on target. Let me tell you a story. Several years ago, when I was an intern in another pharmacy, I watched a pharmacist named Jim deal with Mrs. Franks, a patient like Mrs. Knoll. Mrs. Franks was always complaining about something, and Jim was always complaining about her. I don&#8217;t think he acted this way at first, but over time things got worse. They would get into arguments and would each fuel each other&#8217;s fire. The Arbinger people call this collusion. It&#8217;s a cyclical pattern where one person&#8217;s comments reinforce the feelings and the resultant comments and actions of the other person. It&#8217;s always a vicious circle.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_44"/>Mrs. Franks would come into the pharmacy and complain about something: the cost of the medicine, the time she had to wait in the pharmacy, or even the long delays in her physician&#8217;s office. Sometimes Jim would obstinately fill her prescription last, and he would accuse her of spending her money unwisely so she didn&#8217;t have enough to pay for her medications. They would go round and round. Mrs. Franks would leave angry, and Jim would go back to his other patients muttering under his breath about her. Jim wished she wouldn&#8217;t come back, but she always did.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Then one day Jim was nice to her. I never knew why. Mrs. Franks didn&#8217;t change at first, but over time her attitude toward the pharmacy and maybe even toward life softened. After a few months, Jim and Mrs. Franks were friends. Their relationship was transformed. Jim started taking her blood pressure, giving her thorough medication consultations, teaching her how to use her inhaler, and really taking care of her. I didn&#8217;t realize this at the time, but now I think he saw her as a person, no longer as an obstinate, ornery object.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I see what you&#8217;re saying. And I see how I might be withholding caring and services from Mrs. Knoll, which isn&#8217;t consistent with my responsibilities as a health care professional.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Right. Mrs. Knoll may not even want our services at first, but over time the I&#8211;thou way of being usually helps produce a change in the other person&#8217;s way of being.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Well, I don&#8217;t know how Mrs. Knoll would respond to my first act of kindness toward her. She might faint, and then we would have a problem. Still, I&#8217;d be doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: She might be shocked at first, but deep down she would feel good. And you know, Hank, we need to do what is right no matter how she responds. Think about when you feel happiest or most at peace: when you honor your inner desire to do the right thing for someone, or when you resist it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: That&#8217;s simple&#8212;when I honor the positive feelings.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Right. We&#8217;re most at peace when we&#8217;re out of the box. And our communication with others is helpful and productive only when we&#8217;re out of the box.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_45"/>Hank: We&#8217;d better get back to work. The prescriptions are beginning to pile up.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: OK, Hank.</p>
<p class="indentt">People, not objects, come into our pharmacies. When they come in for prescriptions, they may not feel well. They may feel stressed. They may have pain, concern about loss of life or bodily function, fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, fever, chills&#8212;the list goes on. The way they are feeling may produce behaviors that are difficult for us to deal with. We may cease to see them as people. Even if they act otherwise, most patients want to be taken care of in a kind and thorough manner. They want reassurance, and they want to be respected by a selfless practitioner who is completely focused on their care. When we see our patients as the people they really are, then our only desire will be to help them cure or control their conditions. If we see them as objects, as irrelevant because of their behavior, as a hindrance to our ability to complete our work, or solely as a source of profit, then caring behavior is not likely to occur. If we see them as people, we will use a caring approach to their needs.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><em>Later in the same week:</em></p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Hank: Emily, am I in the box with my patients if I see them as a hindrance to getting all the prescriptions filled in a timely manner? Could I possibly be seeing them only as a source of revenue? I think I&#8217;m beginning to understand your ideas, but I need some help. I may still be in the box, even when I&#8217;m considerate of patients.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: I think you&#8217;re on to something. If we see people as simply a means to an end or as a hindrance to our own accomplishments, then we probably are in the box. I remember once hearing a college faculty member say, &#8220;If we didn&#8217;t have students around here we might get something done.&#8221; Perhaps uncaring faculty are in the box toward their students. In their way of being, students are objects.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: Then, to place the needs of the patient first, we must always see patients as people. Otherwise we will see them as objects and resist our desire to help them. The other night I read that these feelings we have toward others are a way of loving them. I struggled with this concept, but when I read that love is a verb, that it represents an action, then it began to make sense. When I&#8217;m responsive to my patients, I am performing acts of love through my patience, my understanding, my humility or teachability, my honesty with others, my respectfulness, my selflessness, and my forgiving nature. It is my <a id="page_46"/>desire to see them as people. Wow, this is powerful stuff. How do I stay out of the box?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: Good question. I have struggled with that one too. One way might be to identify relationships in which you are out of the box and compare your other experiences to those. Can you see how your relationship with Mrs. Knoll might be different from your relationship with your best friend?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: I sure can. I know we are often blind to our behavior when we&#8217;re in the box. We just have to be on the lookout to be sure we don&#8217;t go into the box in our relationships.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Emily: That&#8217;s all you can do, at first. But after a while it gets easier, and you&#8217;re out of the box most of the time. When you&#8217;re having problems with someone, you can talk to another person, someone with whom you&#8217;re not in the box. You&#8217;ll be reminded of how it feels to be out of the box. It&#8217;s vital to have a good friend who is willing to be honest with you and not just take your side, someone who will help you see that you&#8217;re in the box and feeling victimized. Another way to stay out of the box is to realize that we get &#8220;hooked&#8221; by other people. We all have sensitive emotional areas that get &#8220;bumped into&#8221; by others. We&#8217;ve learned false beliefs about ourselves, such as &#8220;I&#8217;m stupid&#8221; or &#8220;I never get things right.&#8221; We do make mistakes, but we aren&#8217;t stupid. When we get irritated, angry, or hurt, it is likely because something has touched these sensitive areas. This is an opportunity to reflect on what&#8217;s truly going on inside.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Hank: That makes a lot of sense. I do sometimes say negative things to myself. Emily, thanks for talking about this with me. From now on, Mrs. Knoll will be a person with cares, concerns, feelings, emotions, ambitions, strengths, and weaknesses&#8212;just like I am. She is going to get top-notch care, even if I sometimes struggle with the way she behaves.</p>
<p class="indentt">Many &#8220;Mrs. Knolls&#8221; do not make repeat visits to pharmacies because they were offended by the reactive behavior of pharmacists at their first or second visit. The person who is offended and doesn&#8217;t return is likely to tell a dozen other people about the experience. If we can manage problems when they arise and satisfy patients&#8217; concerns, 97&#37; of our patients will return to our pharmacies for their prescriptions and care. If we see all of our patients as people and not objects, we will profit in many ways, and patients will have a better quality of life because of our care.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_47"/>SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Seeing patients as people will enable us to improve their lives. When we become self-deceived and see patients as objects, we run the risk of believing that it is all right to provide less than quality care. That would be most unfortunate and violate the covenant we have with our patients.</p>
