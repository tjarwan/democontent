<h2 class="h2a"><em>PATIENT COUNSELING</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we will explore effective patient counseling. A patient counseling checklist (sidebar) will help you organize information you provide to patients&#8212;and the information you get <em>from</em> patients. Effective counseling is not simply providing information. Patients need information to help them adhere to treatment regimens, but the timing and organization of the message and involvement of the patient are critical in determining what the patient understands and remembers. The counseling session should be thought of as an opportunity for information <em>exchange</em>. You are the expert on drug therapy, but patients are experts on their daily routines, how they understand the illness and its treatment, and whether they anticipate any problems taking the medication as prescribed. All of these things need to be assessed if counseling is to be effective. The counseling checklist<sup><a id="ch5-fn1" href="chapter5.xhtml#ch5_fn1">a</a></sup> is based on a review of the literature to determine how to exchange information in a way that increases the probability that the patient will comply with the treatment regimen. Each point on the checklist is discussed in this chapter. It is assumed that, before the pharmacist counsels the patient, an assessment of the appropriateness of the drug therapy will be made.</p>

<h3 class="h3">POINT-BY-POINT DISCUSSION</h3>

<p class="noindent-hang"><strong><em>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;Pharmacist introduces self</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">It is important for patients to know they are talking to the pharmacist. They may be reluctant to ask questions or express concerns if they believe that the person they are talking to is a technician. Pharmacists should greet the patient, extend a hand, and state their name: &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m James Smith, your pharmacist.&#8221; This begins the relationship.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;Identifies patient or patient&#8217;s agent</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Pharmacists need to know to whom they are talking. When they are talking to the patient directly, information that is communicated is less likely to be confused or distorted than when the pharmacist is talking to the patient&#8217;s agent. In third-party communication, written information becomes even more important than in communication directly with the patient. Pharmacists may need to call patients if they believe the information truly needs to be communicated directly to them.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;Asks if patient has time to discuss medicine</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">If patients do not have time to listen to the information that needs to be provided, then the information will be ineffective. For a new patient, time will be needed to establish a database so that appropriate decisions can be made in the future. If the patient does not have time for this, written information needs to be used, the patient needs to be contacted at a more convenient time, or both.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>4.&#160;&#160;&#160;Explains purpose and importance of counseling session</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">People listen and learn more effectively when they are given reasons for what is being asked of them. For example, patients are less likely to take tetracycline with food or dairy products if they are given a reason why these items should be avoided (decreased absorption and thus decreased effectiveness of the drug). Tell patients why the counseling session will be important from <em>their</em> perspective&#8212;what&#8217;s in it for them. For new patients, explain why the information being gathered is necessary.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><a id="page_62"/><strong><em>5.&#160;&#160;&#160;Asks patient what physician told him or her about the medication and what it is treating. Asks what patient knows or understands about the disease. Uses any available patient profile information (including possible allergies)</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Generally speaking, in any effective counseling session, the patient should talk more than the health care provider. The purpose of the counseling session is to ensure that patients leave the pharmacy with knowledge about the proper use of the medication. It really doesn&#8217;t matter whether the patient gets this information from the pharmacist or the physician. Pharmacists should find out what the patient already knows about the medication and condition before providing the patient with a litany of information. There is no reason for the pharmacist to go over information the patient already has mastered. Accurate information that the patient supplies should be supported and praised. Inaccurate information needs to be corrected, and information that is omitted should be added. Make sure profile information is incorporated and possible allergies are addressed (both seasonal and drug allergies).</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>6.&#160;&#160;&#160;Asks if patient has any concerns prior to information provision</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Many patients have concerns about the medications they are about to take or the condition the physician is treating. Often, they will not vocalize these concerns unless they are asked. It is important to address these concerns immediately with as much understanding as possible. It is not appropriate or useful to tell the patient you will address the concern later in the counseling session. Until the concern is addressed, the patient will not hear other information provided. The pharmacist should make every effort to understand the concerns of the patient and treat the concerns with the attention they deserve. The patient would not have brought them up if they weren&#8217;t important to him or her. If the patient has a concern that is not addressed appropriately, any information that follows will not be internalized.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>7.&#160;&#160;&#160;Responds with appropriate empathy, listening, and attention to concerns. Uses these skills throughout counseling session</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">These skills are absolutely essential to an effective counseling session. The literature on patient compliance identifies the relationship between patient and practitioner as a key variable in predicting compliance with treatment regimens. Patients need to see that health care providers are competent and trustworthy and care about what happens to their patients. These skills are effective tools for communicating caring.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>8.&#160;&#160;&#160;Tells patient the name, indication, and route of administration of the medication</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">This and the steps that follow will generally be accomplished after the pharmacist has determined that the medication is appropriate and <a id="page_63"/>the prescription has been filled. Telling patients the name of the medication helps them to get used to identifying their medication. This is especially important in case of an emergency (e.g., overdosage, ingestion by a child). Stating the indication reinforces the diagnosis and promotes confidence in the appropriateness of the therapy. Although the route of administration often seems obvious, experienced pharmacists have numerous documented cases of patients taking a medication by the wrong route. It should not be assumed that printing this information on the label will cover these points. Many patients cannot read, and those who <em>can</em> read often don&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>9.&#160;&#160;&#160;Tells patient the dosage regimen</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Again, many patients cannot read, so it is important that they be told the dosage regimen. Even patients who <em>can</em> read should be told, either to reinforce what the physician told them or to inform them for the first time. While a particular dosage regimen may seem straightforward or obvious, how many times a day will a patient take medication with directions to &#8220;take one tablet after meals and at bedtime&#8221;? Not everyone eats three meals a day. Patients with diabetes may eat six or seven small meals each day.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>10.&#160;Asks patient if he or she will have a problem taking the medication as prescribed</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">After telling the patient the dosage regimen, the pharmacist should assess whether the patient will have any problems taking the medication as prescribed. This is an important question that is seldom asked by any health care provider. Yet, research shows that the complexity of the dosage regimen can affect compliance and, hence, outcomes. Once-a-day dosing generally achieves rates of compliance of greater than 80&#37;, compared with 40&#37; or less for four-times-a-day dosing. This has important implications for the pharmacist. The total cost of care needs to be considered, not just the cost of the drug. Serious noncompliance as a consequence of more complex dosage regimens may result in hospitalization of the patient. Pharmacists should make every attempt to resolve problems related to the dosage regimen either through tailoring (see below) or by working with the physician to change to a less complicated dosing schedule.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>11.&#160;Tailors medication regimen to patient&#8217;s daily routine</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Any way in which the pharmacist can help the patient connect taking a dose of medication with a daily routine will enhance compliance. This might include identifying when the patient wakes up and goes to bed or which meals the patient eats. It should not be assumed that patients eat three meals per day. To be most effective, pharmacists should ask patients about their daily routines, rather than suggesting routines that the patient may not be comfortable with.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><a id="page_64"/><strong><em>12.&#160;Tells patient how long it will take for the medication to show an effect</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Patients need to know how long it will take before they see an effect from the medication. Noncompliance may occur when patients believe a medication is not working. They may cease taking the medication because they were not told that the onset of action is longer than they expected, or they may take too much medication because they believe one dose did not work.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>13.&#160;Tells patient how long he or she might be on the medication</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Patients need to have a reasonable expectation of how long they will be on the medication. This helps the patient to get into a mindset of compliance. It also helps eliminate unrealistic expectations. Moreover, it gives patients a chance to express concerns about the length of treatment.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>14.&#160;Tells patient when to return for a refill (and number of refills)</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Giving patients this information assists in planning and goal setting for the patient. Patients need to plan to comply with their medication regimens. This information can also be given in the form of a spoken contract. The pharmacist could say, &#8220;Mrs. Jones, the doctor has given you a 30-day supply. Therefore, I&#8217;ll see you on June 30th. See you then?&#8221; This lets the patient knows when to come back, and the patient can tell you if that will be a problem so that alternative plans can be made.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>15.&#160;Emphasizes benefits of the medication and supports its use before talking about side effects (adverse effects) and barriers</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Patients need to know what benefits they will get from taking the medication. Why should they take it? Will they feel better if they do take it? A common mistake that health care providers make is to discuss barriers before exploring the benefits. It is difficult for patients to be motivated to remove barriers if they don&#8217;t understand the benefits of doing so. If the patient cannot think of many benefits, say, &#8220;Here are some other benefits that other patients have mentioned to me. What do you think of those?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent-1">Then discuss barriers and concerns. Before you try to solve these problems, ask for the patient&#8217;s thoughts on overcoming the barriers. Any appropriate solutions the patient comes up with should be praised and supported. If the patient is at a loss, again, say, &#8220;Here are what other patients with diabetes [for example] have come up with to overcome these barriers. Would any of these solutions work for you?&#8221; Some patients are particularly resistant to taking medication as prescribed. <a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a> discusses ways of dealing with patient resistance; see Precontemplation in the section on the transtheoretical model of change.</p>
<p class="indent-1"><a id="page_65"/>Although patients need to know about the major side effects of the medication they will be taking, pharmacists should make every effort to support the chosen therapy and tell patients about the benefits of the treatment before they discuss side effects. This not only helps to put side effects in perspective, it helps the patient have confidence in the therapy. Remember, lack of confidence in the chosen therapy results in a higher rate of noncompliance.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>16.&#160;Discusses major side effects of the drug and whether they will go away in time. Discusses how to manage side effect and what to do if side effect does not go away and becomes intolerable</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Patients need to be aware of side effects so that they know what to do if they occur and so that they do not end up going to another physician to treat a side effect. Through effective counseling, the pharmacist should put side effects in their proper perspective so that patients truly understand the extent of the risk they are taking by using the medication. Some patients may not want to know any side effects, and some will want to know all possible side effects. Generally speaking, patients know better than health care practitioners what is in their best interest. So, pharmacists must develop a flexible approach to the dissemination of information. Information leaflets are an excellent way to provide patients with additional information. Patients should be told whether the side effects will go away in time and, if so, what is a reasonable period of time. The more specific you can be, the better. Are there steps the patient can take to prevent, alleviate, or manage the side effects? What should be done if they don&#8217;t go away? All of these issues need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>17.&#160;Points out that additional rare (emphasizes this to patient) side effects are listed in the information sheet (to be given to patient at the end of counseling session). Encourages patient to call if he or she has any concerns about these</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>18.&#160;Uses written information to support counseling where appropriate</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">For literate patients, written information has been shown to add to spoken instruction. It gives patients something to refer to in case they forget. Written information can be used to promote more effective counseling. It can be given to patients to look over while their prescription is being filled. Patients can then ask better questions, and the pharmacist will do less talking. This has the added benefit of occupying the patient to make the waiting time more tolerable.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>19.&#160;Discusses precautions (e.g., activities to avoid)</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">It should not be assumed that the physician has discussed precautions with the patient. Rather than assuming what the patient does or does not know, ask the patient whether the physician has discussed this subject.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><a id="page_66"/><strong><em>20.&#160;Discusses beneficial activities (e.g., exercise, decreased salt intake, diet, self-monitoring)</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="noindent-hang">The same reasoning applies here as in item 19.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>21.&#160;Discusses drug&#8211;drug, drug&#8211;food, and drug&#8211;disease interactions</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Patients generally are not aware of other medications, foods, or diseases that may interfere with the drug they are taking or the condition for which they are being treated. Having this information is essential to preventing drug-related problems. For example, a patient with high blood pressure should be told to ask the pharmacist before taking any medication for coughs or colds. The patient should be told why these precautions are necessary.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>22.&#160;Discusses storage recommendations and ancillary instructions (e.g., shake well, refrigerate)</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Most patients still store their medications in medicine cabinets in the bathroom&#8212;probably the worst place in the house to keep medications because of heat and humidity. In addition to general storage recommendations for all medications, specific storage recommendations (e.g., refrigeration) and ancillary instructions must be made clear to the patient.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>23.&#160;Explains to patient in precise terms what to do if he or she misses a dose</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Before patients leave the pharmacy, it should be clear to them what to do if they miss a dose. The instructions should be as specific as possible. Actual times of day and specific examples should be used to make this clear. The patient should then be asked, for example, &#8220;What will you do if it is 3 pm and you realize you have missed your noon dose?&#8221; The only way you can assess whether patients understand is by asking them to repeat back the information. When asked if they understand, patients usually say yes, even when they may not understand.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>24.&#160;Checks for understanding by asking patient to repeat back key information (e.g., drug name, side effects, what to do about missed doses)</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">To fully assess whether the patient understands the dosage regimen, the pharmacist can say something like this: &#8220;Mrs. Jones, sometimes I can be a little confusing when I give out information. Just to be sure I was clear, could you tell me again how you are going to take your medication?&#8221; The same can be done concerning side effects, missed doses, storage conditions, and so on. In the interest of saving time, a fill-in-the-blank approach can be taken: &#8220;Mrs. Jones, what time will you take your first dose?&#8221; With this method, correct answers can be praised and incorrect information can simply be corrected. Praise has been shown to reinforce compliance.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><a id="page_67"/><strong><em>25.&#160;Rechecks for any additional concerns or questions</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">The counseling session may have raised additional questions or concerns. Particularly if the patient trusts the pharmacist, these questions or concerns will surface and need to be addressed before the patient leaves the pharmacy. As before, the pharmacist should ask if there are any additional questions or concerns and listen respectfully and carefully to what the patient has to say.</p>
<p class="noindent-hang"><strong><em>26.&#160;Advises patients to always check their medicine before they leave the pharmacy</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">This not only helps familiarize patients with their medications but makes them partners in ensuring that any possible error is detected before the medication is ingested. The pharmacist can say, &#8220;Always check your medicine before you leave the pharmacy. If you have any questions or problems about the way it looks, please notify me. I don&#8217;t intend to make any mistakes, but it&#8217;s good to be cautious. You are the final check.&#8221; By doing this, you are re-emphasizing that this is a partnership in which the patient also has responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>27.&#160;Uses appropriate language throughout counseling session</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">This item is fairly self-explanatory. On occasion, pharmacists use language that is unnecessarily confusing (e.g., say hypertension rather than high blood pressure, or GI instead of gastrointestinal or stomach). Many patients will not say they are confused, because they do not want to appear to be stupid. Pharmacists who are sensitive to the patient&#8217;s nonverbal communication may notice this confusion and say, &#8220;Have I said something that has confused or concerned you?&#8221; Any efforts that can be made to use language that is simple and understandable will promote compliance.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>28.&#160;Maintains control of counseling session</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">A great deal of information needs to be covered in order to counsel the patient effectively. Concerns take time to address. However, all attempts should be made to keep superfluous conversation on the part of the patient and pharmacist to a minimum. There certainly is a place for small talk in the counseling session, but it needs to be brief and simply serve the purpose of breaking the ice.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><strong><em>29.&#160;Organizes information in an appropriate manner</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">This checklist is an attempt to organize the information in an appropriate manner. Generally speaking, the most important information should be provided at the beginning of the counseling session and then repeated at the end. In addition, support of the drug should precede discussion of side effects.</p>
<p class="noindentt-hang"><a id="page_68"/><strong><em>30.&#160;Follows up to determine how patient is doing</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-1">Very few health care providers do follow-up care. Yet, abundant evidence indicates that patients do not get their refills on time and some never come back to get refills. Follow-up care is a good way to differentiate your services, let patients know you are concerned about them, and increase your refill prescription business. Moreover, patients who do not come in on time for refills of maintenance medication are at risk for further problems. Follow-up care should be flexible; some patients may not want it. Patients should be enrolled in a program of follow-up care and given options as to how they receive it. To make follow-up care the most beneficial to the patient, when possible the patient should be given reminder options: Does the patient want to receive reminders by e-mail, voice mail, fax, letter, or post card? Keep in mind that a post card reminder would not be appropriate for medications for treating sensitive conditions such as AIDS or mental illness. The more flexible you can be in providing this service, the more likely it will work.</p>

<h3 class="h3">SAMPLE COUNSELING SCENARIO</h3>
<p class="noindent">The following sample counseling session illustrates the use of the checklist. The patient is a 21-year-old female college student who has been diagnosed as having strep throat. She has been prescribed penicillin V potassium 500 mg to be taken three times a day for 10 days with no refills.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: (extends hand) Hi, I&#8217;m Karen Turner, the pharmacist who filled your prescription. Are you Shelly Jackson?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, I am. I sure hope this is going to help.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I&#8217;ll bet your throat is sore. This medicine is very effective for strep throat if taken properly. Do you have about 5 minutes for me to tell you about your medicine?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, but my throat really hurts.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I bet it does. I just want to make sure that you leave here and know how to use this medicine properly so your throat will stop hurting. Also, I want to let you know about some precautions while using this medicine. I will give you this information sheet when we are done. It summarizes the main points and has the pharmacy&#8217;s phone number in case you have any questions.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_69"/>Pharmacist: What has your doctor told you about this medicine and strep throat?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: He told me that I was probably contagious and would be for at least 48 hours after using the medicine. He also said to use up all of the medicine and that I was getting penicillin.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Very good. That is correct. Since you are new to this pharmacy, I need to ask if you have any allergies to penicillin that you know of.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: No, I have used penicillin before. Isn&#8217;t amoxicillin a kind of penicillin?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Yes, it is. And you had no problems with it? No rash or anything like that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: No.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Good. I need to also ask, do you use birth control pills?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: No. Why would you ask that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Penicillin can reduce the effectiveness of the pill, so you would need to use another contraceptive in addition to the pill while you took this. OK, before we go any further, do you have any questions or concerns?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, yes, a couple of things. I&#8217;ve heard that strep throat can cause heart disease and that some antibiotics don&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Those are important concerns. If strep throat is not treated properly it can cause heart disease. But we are going to make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen. That&#8217;s why the doctor wants you to finish all of your medicine. We&#8217;ll talk more about that. Also, some antibiotics don&#8217;t work because they have not been taken properly. Have you had strep before?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Not that I know of.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I don&#8217;t anticipate any problem here. The strep that is going around does not appear to be penicillin resistant, so you will be fine.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_70"/>Patient: Good.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: OK. The name of your medicine is penicillin V potassium 500 mg, and it is very effective for strep throat. You will be taking one tablet three times a day, equally spaced if possible. This information is on the label. (shows patient the bottle) Do you anticipate any problems taking the medicine as prescribed?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I hope not. I want to get rid of this.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I bet you do. If you have any problems remembering to take the medicine, please let me know right away. I have some devices to help. Now, what time do you normally wake up and go to bed each day?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I get up around 6:30 am and go to sleep around 10:30 or 11 pm.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: OK. I recommend getting as much rest as you can while you are taking this medicine. Take your first tablet when you wake up. If possible, wait an hour before eating breakfast. It is best to take this medicine 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. If you get a little stomach upset from the medicine, you can take food with it. So, take your first tablet at 6:30 am and your next tablet around 2:30 pm if possible, then your last tablet right at bedtime. How does this sound? Does this fit your day?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, I have class from 2 to 3 pm.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It would be OK to take that tablet at either 2 pm or 3 pm. It will take 2 to 3 days before you start feeling a lot better. Remember, during this time you are also contagious. Even though you start to feel better, keep taking the medicine three times each day until it is gone. That will take 10 days. In that way you do not run the risk of heart disease, and we can be sure that the &#8220;bug&#8221; is wiped out. You can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with the sore throat during that time. And again, get as much rest as possible and drink a lot of water.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: There are no refills on this prescription. You should be well in 10 days. As I said, penicillin V potassium is very effective for strep throat, and I am confident that you will be rid of it completely after 10 days. There are some unwanted or side effects of penicillin V <a id="page_71"/>potassium that I also wanted to tell you about. As I mentioned earlier, some people get a little stomach upset or diarrhea from the medicine. If this occurs, you can take it with food. If you get diarrhea and it does not subside in a few days, please give me a call. There are also some more serious reactions that people can have if they are allergic to penicillin. From what you say, you are not. However, just as a precaution, they are listed in this leaflet. If you get a rash or experience shortness of breath or wheezing while you are taking this, you should go to the emergency room. This happens rarely and should not happen to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Sounds scary.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know. These are just precautions. Don&#8217;t overexert yourself over the next 10 days. Keep this medicine in a cool, dry place&#8212;not in the bathroom. There is too much moisture there. A pantry in the kitchen would be good.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I have a cupboard I can put it in.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Would you like an extra vial that is labeled to put in your purse or backpack for your 2 or 3 pm dose?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: That would be great!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I want to tell you what to do just in case you miss a dose. This does happen to all of us at times. If you forget a dose and it is within 2 hours of the next dose, skip that dose and just take the next one. Don&#8217;t double up on doses.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Let&#8217;s say that you forgot your 6:30 am dose and it is now 10:30 am. What should you do?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, since it is still 4 more hours till my next dose, I can take the one I forgot.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Right! What if you forgot your afternoon dose and it is 9:30 pm when you remember?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Skip that dose and just take the 10:30 pm dose.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Great! You got it. Now, we have covered a lot of information. Just to be sure that I wasn&#8217;t confusing, can you tell me again the name of the medicine?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_72"/>Patient: Penicillin V potassium 500 mg.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Good. How are you going to take it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Three times a day: an hour before I eat breakfast, at 2 or 3 pm, and at 10:30 pm. And I&#8217;m supposed to take it till it&#8217;s gone&#8212;for 10 days.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Very good! What do you recall about side effects?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: It can cause stomach upset or diarrhea. If it does, take it with food, and if it doesn&#8217;t go away, call you. If I get a rash or have breathing problems, go to the emergency room.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You are doing great. And remember to get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and take acetaminophen for your throat if you need to do so. OK, one last thing: This is what your medicine looks like. (shows open vial to patient) It is always a good idea to know what your medicine looks like. For one thing, in case someone else ingests it by accident, you could describe it. Second, in case you get a refill (not likely in this case), it should always look like this or you should ask the pharmacist why it doesn&#8217;t. We never intend to make a mistake, but they do occur on occasion. You are the last check.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Actually, that&#8217;s good advice. My grandma takes a lot of medicine, and she should know what it looks like.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I agree. Do you have any more questions or concerns at this point?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: If you leave and something comes up, please don&#8217;t hesitate to call. Our number is on the label and this information leaflet. As I said, I am Karen Turner and would be happy to help.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You are quite welcome. I hope you feel better soon. I may call you in a few days to see how you are doing, if that is OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Sure, that would be fine.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Great. Margie will ring up your prescription. Bye.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Goodbye.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_73"/>PUTTING THE CHECKLIST TO WORK</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many pharmacists are very busy in their practices and may not have the time to be as thorough as this checklist suggests. The checklist is provided as a guide to effective counseling. Time, severity of the illness, and type of medication will be major factors in determining how much or little of the checklist you use. I encourage you to be as thorough as possible to make sure that your patients leave the pharmacy knowing how to take their medications.</p>
