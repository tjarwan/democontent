<h2 class="h2a"><em>PERSUASIVE<br/>COMMUNICATION</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">At one time or another, each of us has tried to persuade someone to do something. Most likely, we have met with varying degrees of success. Certain principles must be followed for persuasive communication to be effective, or it can backfire and cause more resistance to engaging in the target behavior. Much research has been done on persuasive communication. In this chapter, persuasive strategies will be discussed and illustrated to help improve your powers of persuasion.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT IS PERSUASIVE COMMUNICATION?</h3>
<p class="noindent">Communication that is persuasive is directed toward changing or altering another person&#8217;s beliefs, attitudes, and, ultimately, behaviors. According to Engel and colleagues,<sup><a id="ch13-ref1" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref1">1</a></sup> attitudes have three components: <em>cognitive</em>&#8212;the manner in which the attitude object is perceived, <em>affective</em> feelings of like or dislike toward the object, and <em>behavioral</em> action tendencies toward the attitude object. The cognitive component is the person&#8217;s belief about the attitude object. The idea is that beliefs affect attitudes, which affect behaviors: Change a person&#8217;s beliefs or attitudes and you change the person&#8217;s behaviors. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if the world were that simple. Although beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are related, the relationships are not always straightforward. A few examples will help clarify this.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Jones is 80 years old. She knows that many people take medicines and that they get help from them. She, however, doesn&#8217;t like to put any kind of medicine in her body. She believes that medicines can help other people, but she does not like (affective component) medicines, so she won&#8217;t take them.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Smith thinks that Mercedes makes a great car (belief), and he really likes the way a Mercedes looks and performs (affective component). However, he isn&#8217;t going to buy one because he can&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_170"/>Heath Taylor, age 20, believes that medicines can really help people and has taken medicine for illnesses, but he has compliance problems because of his busy schedule.</p>
<p class="indent">These people all have positive beliefs about medications, but their attitudes and behaviors are different. Positive beliefs don&#8217;t necessarily produce positive behaviors. For Mr. Smith, an intervening variable (money) precluded him from purchasing (the behavior) a Mercedes, even though he believes they are good cars and he likes them. Different strategies are needed to effect behavior change. One size does not fit all.</p>
<p class="indent">The terms <em>persuasion</em> and <em>influence</em> are often used interchangeably, but there is a distinction between the two. When someone is influenced by another, there is often a change in the person&#8217;s beliefs, attitudes, or behavior; this sounds a lot like persuasion. However, we can influence people without consciously attempting to do so.<sup><a id="ch13-ref2" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref2">2</a></sup> For example, as a parent, I could positively (or negatively) influence the behavior of my child by the way I interact with others. I may not be consciously aware that my child is watching and learning, but the influence is there nonetheless. Persuasion, on the other hand, is conscious. There is a volitional attempt to influence someone else.</p>
<h3 class="h3">INFLUENCES ON PERSUASIVE MESSAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many factors determine the effectiveness of a persuasive message. Four major factors are (1) the message source, (2) believability of the message, (3) environmental factors, and (4) comprehension and retention of the message. These factors overlap a great deal. Certainly, the credibility of the message source influences the believability of the message, and comprehension and retention of the message are also influenced by the believability of the message.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Message source</strong>. For a persuasive message to have its intended impact, the message source (the pharmacist) must be seen as credible. Credibility involves recognized expertise and the desire to do what is right, serve the patient, be warm, and be fair. Expertise alone is not enough. The patient must perceive that the pharmacist&#8217;s expert power is being used not to manipulate or control, but to do what is best for the patient. Of course, this involves finding out what the patient thinks is best, too. It is important to note that expertise is not ascribed to a pharmacist simply because of a societal role. It must be demonstrated in a way that supports the patient. Expertise that &#8220;puts the patient in his place&#8221; is not generally persuasive. A few examples will illustrate this point.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><em>Mrs. Jones enters the pharmacy to have her antihypertensive medication refilled</em>.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_171"/><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Hello, Mrs. Jones. How are you today?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Just fine. Couldn&#8217;t be better.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Great! I&#8217;ll go refill your prescription.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (a few moments later) Mrs. Jones, I noticed that your blood pressure medicine should have run out several weeks ago. Are you taking your medicine the way you&#8217;re supposed to take it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Oh sure, every time I get a headache.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That doesn&#8217;t make any sense. How often is that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Oh, maybe once a week.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Mrs. Jones, that&#8217;s not how you&#8217;re supposed to take it at all. Where did you get such an idea? Didn&#8217;t you read the label instructions? It says take it every day.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: What&#8217;s your problem? Just give me my medicine! (grabs the bag) Put it on my account. (exits the pharmacy)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: But you&#8217;re not taking it the right way.</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist is in no position to have influence here because of the approach he takes. He will probably have to call Mrs. Jones later and get this situation straightened out. Rather than taking a calm approach, he berates Mrs. Jones. She is unwilling to listen and leaves without finding out what the problem is. Let&#8217;s see how this might have been approached:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Hello, Mrs. Jones. How are you today?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Just fine. Couldn&#8217;t be better.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Great! I&#8217;ll go refill your prescription.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (a few moments later) Mrs. Jones, I noticed that your blood pressure medicine should have run out several weeks ago. Can you tell me how you&#8217;re taking it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Oh sure, every time I get a headache.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_172"/>Pharmacist (calmly): So you take it when you get a headache because you believe that you have headaches when your blood pressure is up?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Exactly!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That makes sense. However, we should have done a better job of explaining to you how to take this medicine.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: What do you mean?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It is certainly true that people with high blood pressure sometimes get headaches. But it is usually stress, not your high blood pressure, that is causing them. It is really very difficult, if not impossible, to tell when your blood pressure is up without measuring it. The medicine should be taken once a day for you to get the most benefit from it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: Once a day? I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Well, let&#8217;s have you start taking it once a day from now on, even if you don&#8217;t have a headache. I want to make sure your blood pressure stays controlled.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Jones: So do I. I never knew.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know. Again, I sure can understand the confusion.</p>
<p class="indentt">This pharmacist took responsibility, and, because he did not blame or berate the patient, she was willing to listen. She was able to be influenced because she felt understood. The pharmacist&#8217;s communication was directed toward solving a problem, not ascribing blame. Even though he knew the label directions were not being followed, he felt no need to point this out and risk embarrassing her.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a great deal of literature indicating that men and women use different persuasive strategies. However, the literature is inconsistent about exactly what those differences in persuasive communication strategies are and whether they result from gender differences or differences in roles. For example, some literature reports that women use a more democratic and participative leadership style to have influence, whereas men tend to be more autocratic and directive.<sup><a id="ch13-ref3" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref3">3</a></sup> Other research attributes these differences more to role in the organization than to gender. That is, as women move higher in the organization, their communication tends to be more autocratic and directive.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_173"/>Regardless, Gilligan and Attanucci<sup><a id="ch13-ref4" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref4">4</a></sup> found that &#8220;men employ a &#8216;justice&#8217; orientation in reasoning about moral choices by emphasizing the importance of rights, respect, and impartiality, whereas women employ a &#8216;care&#8217; orientation in their moral reasoning by emphasizing mutual participation, cooperation, and attention to individuals&#8217; feelings and needs.&#8221; Men are most likely to influence by focusing on rights and responsibilities, and women are likely to influence by emphasizing issues relating to feelings and caring.<sup><a id="ch13-ref5" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref5">5</a></sup> These influence focuses are not right or wrong, they are simply the way many men and women attempt to influence others. These strategies do work, but only for individuals who orient in the same way. Both men and women need to be flexible enough to realize that appeals to justice also work for many women and appeals to emotions and caring also work for many men. A flexible set of influence strategies is needed.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Believability of the message.</strong> The believability of the message is related not only to the credibility of the message source but also to whether the message fits the patient&#8217;s belief system. Some patients may find it very hard to believe (and understand) concepts that we take for granted. For example, potency is often a difficult concept for patients. A patient may have been taking a tablet for pain relief. This tablet was taken twice a day and was quite large, but the patient got no relief despite the fact that he was taking it properly. The physician then prescribed another medication that is more potent, is taken less often, and comes in much smaller tablets. It may be difficult for some patients to accept that this smaller tablet is going to help if the larger one taken twice as often did not help. As a result, the patient may not even try the new medicine unless he is persuaded by the pharmacist. To be persuasive, the pharmacist will first have to acknowledge and objectively reflect back an understanding of the patient&#8217;s beliefs. Then, factual information about potency will have to be given that makes sense to the patient. Analogies may need to be used to allow the patient to understand the concept of potency. One analogy that might make sense to a patient is that of black pepper versus cayenne pepper, the idea being that smaller amounts of cayenne pepper have more potent effects in the mouth than larger amounts of black pepper.</p>
<p class="indent">Another issue that may be difficult to grasp is that many drugs have multiple indications at various dosing schedules. For example, diazepam can be used for anxiety, epilepsy, and muscle relaxation. It is often very difficult for patients to understand how this can occur. Therefore, when a patient asks, &#8220;What&#8217;s this medicine for?&#8221; the best answer is, &#8220;Could you tell me what caused you to see the doctor?&#8221; rather than, &#8220;It&#8217;s for numerous things, like anxiety, epilepsy, and muscle relaxation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_174"/><strong>Environmental factors.</strong> Environmental factors in a pharmacy include privacy, noise, interruptions, and distractions that can affect whether a message is heard and understood. It is important that persuasive messages be delivered in an environment that, to the extent possible, is free from noise, distractions, and interruptions. Each time these things occur, the likelihood of message comprehension and retention decreases. The pharmacist should do as much as possible to create private areas for talking with patients. If this is not possible, then attempts should be made to pull patients away from sources of noise, interruptions, and distractions.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Comprehension and retention</strong>. Obviously, for a persuasive message to be effective it must be understood and recalled. We have already discussed the effects of environmental factors on comprehension and recall. In addition, as one might suspect, the credibility of the message source is a critical variable in comprehension and recall. I probably won&#8217;t listen to the message if I don&#8217;t believe that you are a credible source or if I question the believability of the message.</p>
<p class="indent">Another key factor that affects comprehension is the language level of the message. Is the message conveyed in language that is understood by the receiver? Too often in health care, providers use jargon that is common to medicine and pharmacy but not to patients. For example, a 67-year-old woman came into a pharmacy and asked a pharmacist how her methyldopa lowered her blood pressure. She was told that it was a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. (I wish I could say that I made this up, but it is a true story.) The woman looked confused, but she said, &#8220;Oh, OK,&#8221; and then left the pharmacy. I&#8217;m sure that she found the message believable. I&#8217;m not so sure she understood a word the pharmacist said. It is vitally important to use language the patient can understand. It is better to say &#8220;high blood pressure&#8221; than &#8220;hypertension.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Another comprehension problem has to do with the receiver&#8217;s interpretation of the message. Sometimes, our communication with patients seems clear to us but is open to interpretation by the patient. For example, we know that when we tell patients to &#8220;take one tablet twice a day&#8221; we mean that we want them to take a tablet approximately every 12 hours. But if this meaning is not made explicit, problems may occur. How is the direction to &#8220;take one tablet after meals and at bedtime&#8221; interpreted? It depends on how many meals you eat a day. A patient with diabetes may eat six or seven small meals each day and take seven or eight tablets. I eat two meals a day, so I would take three tablets. If neither of these responses is correct, then we need to be much more explicit in our directions.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the only way to know if a message is understood and can be recalled is to ask patients to repeat back their understanding of the <a id="page_175"/>message. This can be done by simply saying, &#8220;Just to be sure that I wasn&#8217;t unclear about what I told you, can you please tell me how you are going to take your medicine?&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">DIRECT PERSUASIVE STRATEGIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have discussed factors affecting persuasive communication and stated that persuasive communication is a conscious effort to influence the beliefs, attitudes, and, ultimately, the behaviors of another person. We now turn to persuasive strategies. The following paragraphs discuss direct persuasive strategies.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Consciousness-raising.</strong> Consciousness-raising in the pharmacist&#8211;patient relationship involves either providing information about the patient&#8217;s illness and treatment in a straightforward, objective way or helping the patient become more aware of healthy or unhealthy behaviors (or beliefs or attitudes) in which he or she is currently engaged. Regardless, having influence is the objective. Providing information seems straightforward, but the way we communicate information can either result in clarity or cause confusion. The language we use must be clear and understandable. Helping the patient become more aware of healthy or unhealthy behaviors is less straightforward, as the following example shows:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mr. Johnson, I am concerned about the fact that you continue to smoke even though you have asthma.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I feel OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s great. I hope you do. Over time, cigarette smoking will continue to damage your lungs, and your breathing will become more and more difficult. I would hate for you to have to go to the emergency room or be hospitalized. Also, smoking puts you at greater risk for other illnesses.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I didn&#8217;t know asthma was that serious.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It can be if it&#8217;s not controlled, and it&#8217;s almost impossible to control if you continue to smoke. That concerns me a great deal.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I need to give this some serious thought.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know of several products and smoking cessation programs that are helpful. Give me a call when you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_176"/>The pharmacist confronted the patient about his smoking and used consciousness-raising to address the problem directly. The pharmacist was able to have influence on the patient&#8217;s beliefs because he was objective and demonstrated caring.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Messages that arouse fear.</strong> There is research supporting the idea that a message can be persuasive if it arouses fear. The idea is that avoiding problems is rewarding. According to Stubblefield,<sup><a id="ch13-ref6" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref6">6</a></sup> &#8220;Messages that arouse fear can promote health behavior change if they meet the following conditions: (1) the message provides a strong argument that the recipient will suffer a negative consequence if the recommendations are not accepted; and (2) the message provides strong assurance that adoption of the recommendations will eliminate the negative consequences.&#8221; Two studies evaluated the effects of fear-arousing health messages in women. One involved cancer in general and the other involved breast cancer and breast self-examination. The fear-arousal messages did increase participation in preventive measures.<sup><a href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref6">6</a></sup> After hearing a fear-arousal message, the patient must believe that his or her actions will lead to a reduction of the threat. Let&#8217;s see how this might work.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mrs. Ackerman, I am quite concerned that you are taking only about 30&#37; of your doses for your high blood pressure. Given that your blood pressure is 170/110, I am very concerned about your having a stroke or heart attack.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re overreacting? I feel just fine.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s part of the problem. People can&#8217;t tell when their blood pressure is up by how they feel. Most patients feel just fine even when their blood pressure is dangerously high. You are still putting a strain on your heart. It is very important that you take your medicine every day as prescribed to get your blood pressure down and reduce your risk of a stroke or a heart attack.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Can you guarantee that that will keep me from having a heart attack?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I can guarantee that you will greatly reduce your risks and that you are asking for trouble if you don&#8217;t take your medicine as prescribed, each day. Is remembering to take it once a day a problem for you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Not really. I just didn&#8217;t know I was at such high risk.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: This is really very important.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_177"/>patient: OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Please let me know if you have any problems.</p>
<p class="indentt">This pharmacist used a fear-arousing appeal. It worked because the pharmacist expressed caring and concern, because the patient finally understands that she really is at risk, and because she believes that she can do what is necessary to reduce the risk.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Use of vivid information.</strong> Particularly in fear-arousal appeals, research supports the use of vivid rather than abstract information.<sup><a id="ch13-ref7" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref7">7</a></sup> Vivid information includes emotional appeals and examples that the patient can relate to, such as examples of people (famous or otherwise) the patient&#8217;s age. A concrete example helps make abstract information more real to the patient. In the above example of the patient with hypertension, pointing out that another patient recently had a stroke because of uncontrolled blood pressure (without mentioning the patient&#8217;s name) could help this patient understand the problem more clearly.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, the research on negatively framed appeals (fear arousal) versus positively framed appeals has supported negative appeals in promoting health behaviors to avoid risk, such as the risk of cancer or osteoporosis.<sup><a href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref6">6</a></sup> More research is needed to evaluate these findings. Telling patients the benefits of taking their medicine properly and engaging in healthy behaviors is also vitally important.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Linguistic binds.</strong> One last category of direct persuasive appeals will be discussed&#8212;with caution. Linguistic binds are discussed in the persuasion literature and could have relevance to pharmacy practice. However, there is an element of deception in the use of linguistic binds. The speaker, while appearing to offer the other person a choice, is actually trying to move the person toward the choice that the speaker wants that person to make. Using linguistic binds causes one to walk a fine line between influence and manipulation. Here&#8217;s an example of two linguistic binds:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mrs. Smith, I note from this new prescription that you are newly diagnosed with high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, I just came from the doctor.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: The medicine the doctor prescribed is very effective if taken correctly.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Oh, believe me, I&#8217;ll take it correctly. I don&#8217;t want to have a stroke.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_178"/>Pharmacist: Great! Dr. Stevens probably told you that the only way we can really know if your blood pressure is being controlled is to take regular readings using a blood pressure cuff.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, he did say I should take my medicine even if I feel fine.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Good. Since you will only be seeing Dr. Stevens every 3 months, I would like to either show you a blood pressure cuff for home use or offer a monitoring service that costs $30 per month for unlimited readings that I will fax to your doctor every 2 weeks. Which would you prefer?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Uh, I guess I would rather have the monitoring service.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Great. Would you like to go ahead and set up your first appointment now, or when&#8217;s a good time for you to meet to take your blood pressure? (Pharmacist has pen in hand to jot down a time.)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I guess Friday mornings.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Good. 10 am this Friday?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK.</p>
<p class="indentt">Several issues need to be discussed here. First, offering to sell a blood pressure cuff or a monitoring service certainly is appropriate for any patient with high blood pressure. If patients with high blood pressure regularly had their blood pressure monitored, far fewer strokes or heart attacks might occur. Both times that the pharmacist uses the linguistic bind, the illusion of choice is presented. In the first bind, the pharmacist wants to sell a product or a service, either of which would benefit the patient and the pharmacist. The choice that&#8217;s left out is to buy neither. In the second bind, the illusion of choice is setting up the first appointment. It&#8217;s hard to argue against monitoring high blood pressure. It is a good thing for the patient to do. However, what concerns people about linguistic binds is the element of confusion or deception created. It seems not quite honest. Here, the expertise, authority, and power the pharmacist has is being used to force a choice. The linguistic binds are being used to benefit the patient and the pharmacist. Binds that benefit only the pharmacist at the expense of the patient are not appropriate and are ethically questionable.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_179"/>WHEN DIRECT PERSUASIVE ATTEMPTS FAIL</h3>
<p class="indent">Even when all of the above guidelines are followed, there are times when persuasive strategies don&#8217;t work or aren&#8217;t very effective. When people strongly resist change, direct persuasive strategies are usually ineffective. These direct strategies often take the form of advice giving or &#8220;yes, but&#8230;&#8221; communication. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mr. Johnson, since you have asthma, you really need to quit smoking.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mr. Johnson: (yes, but) I&#8217;m really not ready to quit. I like it too much. It relaxes me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (yes, but) Don&#8217;t you think your health is important?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mr. Johnson: (yes, but) Why don&#8217;t you let me worry about that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (yes, but) I don&#8217;t think you understand how serious this is.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mr. Johnson: (yes, but) I don&#8217;t think <em>you</em> understand how serious <em>I</em> am!</p>
<p class="indentt">This could go on and on&#8212;and usually does. The &#8220;yes, buts&#8221; actually force the patient to defend the very behavior you are trying to change. Remember, persuasion involves a conscious attempt to <em>influence</em>, not an attempt to <em>coerce</em> or <em>convince</em>. To influence people, it is especially important that they feel they are not being coerced or manipulated and that they have choices. Otherwise, people&#8212;especially resistant people&#8212;dig in further. The work of Miller and Rollnick<sup><a id="ch13-ref8" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref8">8</a></sup> and Prochaska and colleagues<sup><a id="ch13-ref9" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref9">9</a></sup> has added much to our understanding of patient resistance. Ambivalence is often the cause of such resistance.<sup><a href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref8">8</a></sup> When people are ambivalent, they often do nothing. Therefore, one approach is to provide objective, nonjudgmental information. If the patient is informed but is not ready to change because he or she is ambivalent about the ability to make the necessary changes, different strategies are needed.</p>
<p class="indent">One influence strategy involves attempting to see the world as the patient sees it and then clearly defining the choices that need to be made. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Because of your asthma, I&#8217;m very concerned about your continuing to smoke.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_180"/>Patient: I&#8217;m just not ready to quit. It really relaxes me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It would be hard to give up something that&#8217;s relaxing.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yeah, no kidding. You ever tried to quit smoking?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: No, but I know that it&#8217;s very hard for most people. I wanted you to know that I am concerned because smoking can make your asthma much worse. I do have some smoking cessation products that could help when you are ready to quit. The choice really is up to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I appreciate that. I&#8217;m just not ready.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I understand. If you haven&#8217;t had a chest X-ray lately, you might consider that just to make sure everything is OK. At least it would give you additional information for making an informed decision. Let me go ahead and show you how this asthma inhaler works.</p>
<p class="indentt">This pharmacist was informative but did not try to coerce the patient into quitting. We cannot make people change their behavior. The pharmacist opened a door for future conversation and kept it open by nonjudgmentally directing his communication at what was appropriate for this patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Another strategy that often works for resistant patients involves self-persuasion and the use of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance theory states that a feeling of dissonance or distress occurs in people when they do or say something that runs in direct opposition to their beliefs or their self-concept. To reduce the dissonance produced, people will &#8220;try to bring those disparate cognitions into greater harmony.&#8221;<sup><a id="ch13-ref10" href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13_ref10">10</a></sup> It has been found that dissonance is very self-motivating. Therefore, if we can create dissonance in our communication with another, this will stimulate individuals to persuade themselves to do something to reduce the dissonance. Here are two examples of how this might work:</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 1</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I&#8217;m just not ready to quit smoking. I find it very relaxing.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: What would you tell your teenage daughter, Sara, about smoking?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I&#8217;d tell her not to do it.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_181"/>Pharmacist: Because?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: For obvious health reasons, cost, and the like.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Your smoking and the advice you would give seem a little inconsistent.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I suppose they are.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 2</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I&#8217;m just not ready to quit smoking. I find it very relaxing.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It would be hard to give up something you find relaxing. What else do you like about smoking?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: It gives me something to do with my hands, and I especially like lighting up after a meal. It&#8217;s very relaxing. It also helps me keep weight off.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Those things are important. Do you see any downside to smoking?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Oh sure, the usual health reasons, plus my wife says my breath and clothes smell. And it&#8217;s become more and more expensive.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: So on the one hand, smoking relaxes you, gives you something to do with your hands, and keeps you from gaining weight, but on the other hand you realize that it is very bad for your health, your wife says your breath and clothes smell, and it&#8217;s expensive.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Right.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I did want you to know that I am concerned about your smoking, but I won&#8217;t bug you about it. I do have some things that can help you stop if you get to that point.</p>
<p class="indentt">In example 1, the pharmacist creates dissonance by creating a discrepancy between the patient&#8217;s beliefs or values and what he actually does. In example 2, the dissonance is created by repeating back what the patient says is positive and negative about smoking. The dissonance becomes the stimulus for change. In both examples, the pharmacist is nonjudgmental and does not attempt to move the patient along too quickly&#8212;which would only create more resistance (see <a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_182"/>SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">This chapter has described general principles of persuasive communication. In addition, direct and indirect examples of persuasive communication have been explored. The use of influence strategies that benefit the patient and enhance patient care has been emphasized. The reader is encouraged to try out several of these strategies, because patients respond to different forms of influence.</p>
