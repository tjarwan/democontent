<h2 class="h2a">LISTENING AND<br/>EMPATHIC<br/>RESPONDING</h2>
<p class="noindent">Probably no other skills are more valuable in developing trust than listening and empathic responding. Trust is essential in developing a therapeutic alliance and effective therapeutic relationships. Squier<sup><a id="ch4-ref1" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref1">1</a></sup> discussed the importance of practitioner empathy in predicting treatment adherence, noting the following: (1) Patient adherence is higher when physicians allow patients to express and dissipate their tensions and anxiety about their illness and when physicians take the time to carefully answer the patient&#8217;s questions; (2) practitioners who demonstrate responsiveness to patients&#8217; feelings have patients with higher adherence rates and better satisfaction with the relationship; (3) patients who perceive their physicians as understanding and caring are more likely to carry out the treatment plan and ask for further help or advice when they need it; and (4) health care providers who encourage patients&#8217; expressions of feelings and participation in the treatment plan have patients with higher rates of adherence. These findings have important implications for pharmacy practice. Again, feeling understood strengthens the therapeutic alliance between the patient and the provider. This, in turn, improves treatment adherence.</p>
<p class="indent">As a health care provider, what should you be listening for from the patient? What do you need to understand? Is it the progression of the disease? Is it the presentation of symptoms? Far too often this is the only information the health care provider gathers. What is really needed is an understanding of how illnesses affect people. We need a shift from treating the disease to treating people who are ill. Even our language in health care reduces people to their illnesses. We call patients diabetics, arthritics, hypertensives, and so on. In actuality, diabetes is only part of who the individual is. Our lives are far more complex than our illnesses. If we are to be effective in helping to treat our patients&#8217; illnesses, we need to start understanding more about the individual. How does this patient interpret the illness and <a id="page_50"/>its treatment? For example, does the patient understand what diabetes is? Does the patient understand the treatment plan? Are there any perceived barriers to carrying out the treatment plan? Is the patient frightened? Overwhelmed? This kind of information needs to be gathered, understood, and responded to in a way that conveys caring. How do we do this?</p>
<h3 class="h3">THE LISTENING PROCESS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to get clarification and accurately see the world as the patient sees it, listening is absolutely necessary. Listening is hard work. It takes effort. Listening is an active process, while hearing is passive.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="chapter4.xhtml#fig4.1">Figure 4-1</a> shows the process of listening. The process starts with an act of will. We must first will ourselves to listen. I must consciously say to myself, &#8220;I am going to listen.&#8221; Next, we must give someone our complete and undivided attention. Often, people do not pay attention long enough to be good listeners. Attention is an essential element of listening. Attention must be given; therefore, it is a gift. Giving patients your attention is one powerful way to let them know that they are valuable. Everyone needs this. To give someone your attention takes will and effort. It is something that is consciously done. Giving attention requires that you not be distracted or interrupted and hurriedly saying to the other, &#8220;Go ahead, I&#8217;m listening. You just said&#8230;&#8221; Listening is not simply repeating the words back. Attention means that you focus your energy on the needs of this person.</p>
<p class="indent">Probably the greatest barrier to true listening is our tendency to judge or evaluate the communication, problem, or feelings of the other. Understanding is different from evaluation of rightness or wrongness, goodness or badness. To truly listen, we must temporarily give up our need to judge&#8212;give up the perspective that our frame of reference is the correct one. This is a process called bracketing.<sup><a id="ch4-ref2" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref2">2</a></sup> It is very difficult to do. It is the giving up of prejudices, biases, or frames of reference before you listen. For example, a woman tells a man friend about an upsetting encounter she had with another friend. He thinks that this is typical of the way women respond. By definition, he has not listened, because of the judgment he has made. By lumping his friend with all women, he fails to see how she uniquely has been affected by the encounter. As a result, he fails to truly listen and be empathic.</p>
<p class="indent">Only through true listening can a person be empathic. The focus of true listening is not so much on the correctness of an idea that is expressed; the idea itself is subjective. The idea is not an absolute. With listening, focus shifts from ideas to feelings used to express the idea&#8212;the commitment to the idea. This is what true listening is about: seeing the idea from the other&#8217;s perspective, then feeding that back. Through the empathic response, people begin to feel understood. It is the consistency of empathic responses over time that produces trust. I will discuss this further in the section on empathy. Listening takes great courage, because in the process of truly listening to someone else&#8217;s ideas or feelings without judgment, you run the risk of being changed by the ideas&#8212;of questioning your own ideas.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_51"/><img src="images/page51.jpg" alt="Image"/></p>
<p class="caption" id="fig4.1"><strong>FIGURE 4-1</strong> The Process of Listening and Empathic Response</p>
<p class="indentt">A common way of responding that gets in the way of listening is trying to fix a problem the other person is describing. When people present us with a problem or are having a difficult time emotionally, we often become anxious. We believe we must <em>do</em> something immediately. We want to quickly fix or minimize whatever is wrong in order to reduce our own anxiety. Usually the problem does not get solved this way, and the patient ends up feeling even less understood.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the primary reasons for listening and empathic responding is to help the patient feel less alone or isolated. As Carl Rogers<sup><a id="ch4-ref3" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref3">3</a></sup> states, &#8220;For the moment, at least, the recipient finds himself or herself a connected part of the human race. &#8230; If someone else knows what I am talking about, what I mean, then to this degree I am not so strange, or alien, or set apart. I make sense to another human being. So I am in <a id="page_52"/>touch with, even in relationship with, others. I am no longer an isolate.&#8221; To put this another way, when we feel alone in a problem, hopelessness often goes with that. If no one else understands, the problem seems unsolvable. If someone can express understanding at an emotional level, then the person is not alone. If someone else can understand, then the problem must be solvable. At least, so it seems. Therefore, listening and empathic responding offer hope. The next time a patient presents a problem and you feel anxious, use that anxiety as a trigger to demonstrate your understanding, rather than trying to escape your anxiety by minimizing the problem.</p>
<h3 class="h3">EMPATHIC RESPONDING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Empathic responding is crucial in building an effective therapeutic alliance. The word empathy is derived from the German word <em>Einfuhlung</em>. This word means that we can actually share the experience of another. It is different from sympathy. Sympathy is feeling sorry for another. Empathy is feeling or experiencing affectively with another. It is a neutral process. This means there is no judgment or evaluation of the person or feelings involved. Sympathy is not neutral. Empathy has been defined as an objective identification with the affective state of an individual.<sup><a id="ch4-ref4" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">To better understand empathy, several concepts must be understood: identification, imitation, and affective communication. Before an empathic response can be made, one must experience the affective state of the other. Empathy involves identification with the affective experience of the other. It does not involve identifying with the other person in total, nor does it mean that you have shared the same experience in actuality. It is not necessary to have experienced the loss of a loved one to experience the grief that the person standing before you is experiencing. Too often people believe that one must have had the same experience to be empathic. But this can simply get in the way, because a subjective component is now added: your experience of a similar event. This may interfere with your capacity to identify with the unique affective state of the other. Empathy takes courage, because it means you must be open to the affective experience of another. Often this experience is painful. (Of course, we should also be empathic with the joy and happiness of others.) There is a tendency to avoid the experience rather than be with the experience and be truly useful and available to the other.</p>
<p class="indent">Imitation is also part of the empathic process. Often, without realizing it, we imitate or mimic the facial expressions or body posture of the other, particularly when a painful experience is recounted. This is a form of identification with the affective state and signals some empathic understanding. This is affective communication. This form of <a id="page_53"/>communication cannot be accomplished if one is distracted or interrupted&#8212;a key reason why giving total attention is important.</p>
<p class="indent">The empathic process always results in the acquisition of knowledge by both parties&#8212;in coming to know one another. It does not involve like or dislike, good or bad, but is a neutral process. Behavior is not prescribed, and the other&#8217;s feelings are not evaluated. You simply come to know more fully how this other person relates to a problem or a situation.</p>
<p class="indent">Reflecting this understanding back to the other is always transforming or growth producing. If it is not, then we are not dealing with the process of empathy. A few cautions are in order here. First, although empathic understanding is always transforming, it is not always soothing. It may, in fact, be painful at times.</p>
<p class="indent">This leads to my second caution about empathy. Empathy does not mean giving in or giving up. Empathy is with a person&#8217;s affective state or situation, not with the person&#8217;s demands. For example, a company sales representative enters a pharmacy and asks the owner to purchase some of his company&#8217;s products. The owner does not carry that line of products and has no desire to start doing so. The company representative states sincerely, &#8220;This would really help me out. I&#8217;m having a tough month and could use the business. My boss is pushing me about meeting quotas. How about a small order?&#8221; The owner responds, &#8220;You sound worried. I really hope you make your quota, but I don&#8217;t carry your product line and don&#8217;t want to at this time.&#8221; The owner responds empathically to the concern of the salesperson but does not give in to the request. It should be noted that empathy cannot be conveyed in a clich&#233;d manner. If the owner had said what he did without sincerity or caring, his response would not be empathic.</p>
<p class="indent">One last distinction needs to be made. One can be empathic without responding empathically. It is possible for me to experience the internal affective state of another without responding in a manner that reflects that understanding. (Identifying with the affective state of the other means being able to sense the actual emotions the other is experiencing.) It is through the empathic response that the other feels understood. Therefore, the way we respond is very important and often difficult. Sometimes, the best empathic response is to simply listen, nod one&#8217;s head, and say nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is an example, adapted from an article in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>,<sup><a id="ch4-ref5" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref5">5</a></sup> of how being empathic does not always lead to an empathic response. A patient is explaining to the pharmacist how she felt when she learned she had diabetes. She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just shocked. I just don&#8217;t believe it. Now I have to start using insulin. I just&#8230;,&#8221; and the pharmacist interrupted with, &#8220;You just feel overwhelmed and don&#8217;t quite know what you&#8217;re going to do?&#8221; The patient said, rather despondently, <a id="page_54"/>&#8220;Yeah, I guess.&#8221; She no longer wanted to talk about this situation. She paid for her medication and left the pharmacy.</p>
<p class="indent">What happened here? Clearly, the pharmacist accurately reflected her affective state. However, the patient did not perceive the interruption as understanding. Either she felt exposed by the pharmacist&#8217;s response and was therefore uncomfortable in continuing, or she truly wanted to struggle with her experience and perceived the pharmacist&#8217;s interruption as interfering. Understanding the patient&#8217;s internal affective experience did not produce an empathic response. Was the pharmacist wrong in his response? The question is not one of right or wrong, but of whether the response benefited the patient. As much as we may want to, we cannot respond perfectly. We can, however, be sensitive and caring enough to observe what happens after we respond, and adjust our responses accordingly. In this case, it would have been appropriate to not push the patient any farther and to apologize for the interruption.</p>
<p class="indent">Health care providers sometimes express concern about the use of empathy. The concern is that being empathic will make the relationship with the patient too personal. Often, the solution is to remain aloof or emotionally distant. Gadow<sup><a id="ch4-ref6" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref6">6</a></sup> states that &#8220;a solution to the personal/professional dichotomy can be proposed in the following way. Professional involvement is not an <em>alternative</em> to other kinds of involvement, such as emotional, esthetic, physical, or intellectual. It is a deliberate synthesis of all of these, a participation of the <em>entire</em> self, using every dimension of the person as resource in the professional relation.&#8221; In fact, anything less than this reduces the patient to an object. As stated by Rogers,<sup><a id="ch4-ref7" href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4_ref7">7</a></sup> &#8220;To withhold one&#8217;s self as a person and to deal with the other person as an object does not have a high probability of being helpful.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">DIALOGUES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The following case demonstrates what is inappropriate (Dialogue 1) and appropriate (Dialogue 2) in terms of empathic response to a patient. I hope this chapter will help you respond to your patients in a way that communicates caring.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Allison is a regular patient in your pharmacy. She is 62 years old and was diagnosed with arthritis more than a year ago. For the past year you have worked with her in getting her arthritis under control so that the pain is manageable. You have helped her with an exercise routine and have enrolled her in a refill reminder program to help her take her nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent in a way that relieves her arthritis pain while minimizing the side effects. She is doing much better now than she was a year ago. She approaches the pharmacy with a distressed look on her face. She hands you a prescription for an oral agent to treat diabetes.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_55"/>Dialogue 1</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Mrs. Allison: I need to get this filled. (dejectedly) I feel like I&#8217;m falling apart. First my arthritis and now this.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Come on now, Mrs. Allison, it can&#8217;t be all that bad.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: What do you mean? It seems like ever since I turned 60, it&#8217;s been one thing after another. First I find out I have arthritis, now I have diabetes. What next? I just feel like I&#8217;m falling apart.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Oh, Mrs. Allison. It&#8217;ll be OK. We&#8217;ll get your diabetes under control. Don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;re doing better with your arthritis, aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: Well, yes, but&#8230;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (interrupts) Well, see, we&#8217;ll lick this, too. You&#8217;re getting upset over nothing. It&#8217;s going to be OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: What do you mean over nothing? Do you have arthritis? Do you have diabetes? You don&#8217;t have to take all this medicine and watch your diet and wonder what&#8217;s going to happen to you next.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: But, Mrs. Allison, I was just trying to help.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: Just fill my prescription. I don&#8217;t need this kind of help.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">Mrs. Allison is feeling dejected and overwhelmed. The pharmacist attempts to &#8220;help&#8221; her by trying to make the problems seem less overwhelming and more manageable. This is a reasonable goal, but Mrs. Allison is not ready to see this. She feels out of control and worries about what is going to happen to her next. She needs someone to listen. She needs someone who is willing to express understanding of how she feels. People often say it is hard to relate to someone like Mrs. Allison because they don&#8217;t have multiple chronic conditions so they don&#8217;t know what this experience is like. It is important to remember that being empathic means identifying with (or relating to) the affective component, not the experience. All of us have felt overwhelmed, even if we have not had multiple chronic illnesses. It is the feeling of being overwhelmed, out of control, or dejected that we attempt to understand and reflect back our understanding of.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"/>Although the pharmacist may have been trying to help, Mrs. Allison certainly did not find him helpful. In situations like this we find people who are distressed, and we want to say or do the right thing to help them. Their distress or discomfort often results in our feeling anxious. This anxiety is normal, but what we do with the anxiety may help others or alienate them. If our communication attempts to relieve us of anxiety, it usually will backfire, because it is egocentric (and empathy is the opposite of egocentricity). What is needed is the ability to use the anxiety as a stimulus to be present, attentive, and caring through effective listening and empathic responding. This is generally more productive.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Mrs. Allison: I need to get this filled. (dejectedly) I feel like I&#8217;m falling apart. First, my arthritis and now this.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (concerned) Mrs. Allison, you sound down.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: I am. It seems like ever since I turned 60, it&#8217;s been one thing after another. First I find out I have arthritis, now I have diabetes. What next? I just feel like I&#8217;m falling apart.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: So you&#8217;re really feeling pretty overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: Well, sure. I do all that work to get my arthritis to stop hurting me so much, and now I find out I have diabetes. Next month they&#8217;ll tell me I have high blood pressure or cancer or something.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It sounds like you&#8217;re worried that it&#8217;s going to be one thing after another from now on.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: Wouldn&#8217;t you be?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I don&#8217;t know, but I do want to help you manage the diabetes, just like we worked on the arthritis. We&#8217;ll take things one step at a time. I don&#8217;t have any reason to believe that anything else is wrong, do you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: No, but I didn&#8217;t know 2 years ago all of this would happen.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: This really took you by surprise.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: Yeah, it did.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_57"/>Pharmacist: I&#8217;m going to go ahead and fill this prescription, and then we&#8217;ll go over this medicine and how you&#8217;re going to use it and find out what your doctor told you about the diabetes. OK?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mrs. Allison: (still dejected) Sure, go ahead.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist was able to listen carefully to Mrs. Allison and reflect back his affective understanding of what she was feeling. He was very accurate in this reflection, as indicated by her responses. Although he was very empathic throughout this conversation and did not attempt to minimize the problem, Mrs. Allison was still feeling dejected.</p>
<p class="indent">Empathy does not cure people. It allows them to process what they are feeling, feel safe about expressing it, and gain insight into what they are feeling and why. This does not mean the feelings go away magically. We should not expect empathy to cause people to feel wonderful immediately. We can expect that it will assist people in working through the feelings so that they can move forward more rapidly than if the feelings aren&#8217;t acknowledged or processed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Listening and empathic understanding enable us to respond to others in a caring and respectful manner. Helping patients feel understood can strengthen the relationship and improve adherence to treatment regimens.</p>
