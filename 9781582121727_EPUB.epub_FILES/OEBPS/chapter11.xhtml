<h2 class="h2a"><em>SUPPORTIVE<br/>COMMUNICATION</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is fairly common for patients to come to the pharmacy and present a prescription and then say or do something that indicates they are distressed. The distress is often related to whatever problem the prescription is attempting to solve or alleviate. Sometimes the distress is related to some other event or events. Because the pharmacist is a health care provider&#8212;one who is supposed to render care&#8212;it seems reasonable to expect pharmacists to be able to respond in these situations in a way that communicates caring, concern, or comfort to the patient. This is supportive communication.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, we will examine the benefits of supportive communication, different ways to respond with supportive communication, problems associated with supportive communication, and unsupportive or unhelpful messages. Many of the ideas and concepts in this chapter are derived from the work of Albrecht, Burleson, and Goldsmith.<sup><a id="ch11-ref1" href="chapter11.xhtml#ch11_ref1">1</a></sup> Readers can find more information on the subject in that outstanding reference.</p>
<h3 class="h3">NEED FOR SUPPORTIVE COMMUNICATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">As stated by Basch,<sup><a id="ch11-ref2" href="chapter11.xhtml#ch11_ref2">2</a></sup> &#8220;though we tend not to be aware of it, the need to communicate on some level with other human beings&#8212;that is, to make ourselves understood or understandable, and in doing so feel cared for, safe, stimulated, and appreciated&#8212;remains the prime motivator for all that we do or don&#8217;t do.&#8221; Supportive communication allows people to feel understood and less alone.</p>
<p class="indent">Squier<sup><a id="ch11-ref3" href="chapter11.xhtml#ch11_ref3">3</a></sup> discussed the importance of practitioner understanding in predicting treatment adherence. According to Squier, (1) patient adherence was higher when physicians allowed patients to express and dissipate their tensions and anxiety about their illness and when physicians took the time to carefully answer the patient&#8217;s questions; (2) practitioners who demonstrated responsiveness to patients&#8217; feelings had patients with higher adherence rates and better satisfaction with the relationship; <a id="page_148"/>(3) patients who perceived their physicians as understanding and caring were more likely to carry out the treatment plan and ask for further help or advice when they needed it; and (4) health care providers who encouraged patients&#8217; expressions of feelings and participation in the treatment plan were found to have patients with higher rates of adherence. These are important findings with significant implications for pharmacy practice. Again, feeling understood strengthens the relationship between the patient and the provider. This may improve treatment adherence and encourage the patient to continue to frequent the pharmacy. In addition to the emotional and psychological benefits, supportive communication has been demonstrated to have physical and health benefits, improve resistance to infection and disease, and extend life.<sup><a href="chapter11.xhtml#ch11_ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h3">TYPES OF SUPPORTIVE COMMUNICATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">This discussion will focus on responding supportively when patients are distressed. This type of interaction is often difficult for people, because they want to be supportive and sometimes aren&#8217;t sure what to say or how to say it. Although it is equally important to respond to people when they are expressing happiness or joy, most of us are fairly comfortable about responding to people when they are in a good mood. In either case, the key is to understand the validity and importance of the feelings being expressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients often express sadness when they find out they have a chronic illness, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma. Their sadness results from a feeling of loss. The loss, usually permanent, involves losing something good, desirable, or pleasurable from the patient&#8217;s perspective. The loss could involve needing to give up certain foods. It could mean needing to give up certain habits, such as smoking. Although most health care providers would agree that smoking is not a good thing, it still may be pleasurable or relaxing to the patient. The loss might also involve a general sense of loss of invincibility. A chronic illness reminds us that we are growing old and won&#8217;t live forever.</p>
<p class="indent">When a patient is saddened by such losses, the purpose of supportive communication is to help the patient accept the loss. This is done by legitimizing the patient&#8217;s feelings, acknowledging the importance and permanence of the loss to the patient, and encouraging the patient to accept the loss.<sup><a href="chapter11.xhtml#ch11_ref3">3</a></sup> Let&#8217;s look at an example:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I thought I just had some allergies. Now I find out I have asthma. Doc says I have to give up smoking. It&#8217;s one of the few things that relaxes me.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_149"/>Pharmacist: It sounds like finding out about asthma has been difficult for you. It could be very hard to stop smoking, since it&#8217;s so relaxing for you. That would certainly help your asthma, though.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yeah, I know. It&#8217;s just tough.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It sounds difficult.</p>
<p class="indentt">Note that this pharmacist does not try to make everything better. The pharmacist doesn&#8217;t try to cheer up the patient and point out all the benefits of not smoking and all the good things in the patient&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s too soon for that. That may be useful at some point, but not now.</p>
<p class="indent">Becoming ill also evokes fear and anxiety in patients. These two emotions occur because the patient experiences ambivalence, circumstances seem uncontrollable, or there is a perceived or real threat to the patient. The same illness that produces sadness in one patient may produce fear or anxiety in another patient. Therefore, pharmacists must be sensitive to how each patient uniquely processes the illness and its treatment. For patients who are fearful or anxious, supportive communication focuses on legitimizing the feelings of the patient, &#8220;reducing the individual&#8217;s uncertainty about the situation, enhancing the individual&#8217;s sense of efficacy or control, modifying judgments about the harmfulness of a perceived threat, or identifying ways to escape from the threat.&#8221;<sup><a href="chapter11.xhtml#ch11_ref1">1</a></sup> Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: The doctor told me I have high blood pressure. Am I gonna have a heart attack?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: This must be very frightening for you. It&#8217;s true that patients who have uncontrolled high blood pressure for a sustained period of time are at a higher risk for a heart attack, but the medicine your doctor has prescribed is very effective at controlling blood pressure if it&#8217;s taken once a day as prescribed.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: So, if I take this, I won&#8217;t have a heart attack?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I feel very confident that if you take this medicine properly, cut down on salt in your diet, and get some moderate exercise on a regular basis you will greatly reduce the risk of a heart attack. It really is up to you. I know these are things that you can handle without a problem.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I hope so.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_150"/>The pharmacist in this situation legitimized the patient&#8217;s concern, then gave the patient a realistic appraisal of the risks of a heart attack. The pharmacist helped to reduce uncertainty by letting the patient know about those things that are under his control, then supported the self-efficacy of the patient by letting him know that he could do what is necessary to escape the threat of a heart attack.</p>
<p class="indent">Shame, embarrassment, and guilt are other emotions that are evoked by one&#8217;s own illness and the illness of loved ones. Shame and embarrassment result from feeling &#8220;caught&#8221; when you don&#8217;t want to be caught. Shame or embarrassment occurs when a person&#8217;s character or competence is questioned (either privately or publicly)&#8212;when the person&#8217;s self-image is either challenged or confirmed (some people already believe they are not competent or worthy of respect). If a patient is treated like a child and shamed by a physician for not following her treatment plan correctly (in the eyes of the physician), that shame may have been converted to anger or intolerance by the time she reaches the pharmacy. This is a very difficult situation. Supportive communication is needed to let the patient know that she still deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of whether she followed the treatment regimen. But the patient&#8217;s anger or intolerance may be met with far less than supportive communication by the pharmacist. The key for the pharmacist is to stay separate from the patient&#8212;that is, to not be taken in by the patient&#8217;s anger. Here is an example:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Here, fill this! (tosses prescription on the counter angrily)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Sounds like this has been a difficult day.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Hmmf. Difficult day&#8230;you people think it&#8217;s so easy to take all of this medicine and change your whole life when you get ill!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I hope I haven&#8217;t given you that impression. I know that keeping your diabetes under control takes a lot of effort and hard work.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: You&#8217;re darn right it does. Tell that to Dr. Harris.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You don&#8217;t think he understands that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Not a bit. I don&#8217;t deserve to be belittled like a child because my weight isn&#8217;t where he thinks it ought to be.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Sounds like you had a very difficult time with Dr. Harris today.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_151"/>Patient: He has no idea how hard I&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You really have tried hard.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, I have.</p>
<p class="indentt">In this situation, the pharmacist does not take the patient&#8217;s anger personally. He supports the patient without taking sides and without assuming that the patient&#8217;s story about Dr. Harris is accurate or inaccurate. The pharmacist simply responds to what the patient is having difficulty with and supports her character.</p>
<p class="indent">Guilt arises when people believe they did something they should not have done or didn&#8217;t do something they should have done. A feeling of helplessness goes with guilt. The goal of supportive communication in dealing with another&#8217;s guilt feelings is to first acknowledge the feeling and then ask what the other person thinks he or she can do to change those feelings of guilt. Finally, support and encourage the action steps the person identifies.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient&#8217;s mother: I just wish I would have checked his peak flow more often. If I had, he wouldn&#8217;t have had to go to the emergency room again. I could have done something. He&#8217;s only 9 years old, and he&#8217;s been through so much.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You&#8217;re feeling somewhat responsible for his needing to go to the emergency room.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient&#8217;s mother: Well, sure. I&#8217;m his mother.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It&#8217;s hard to see these things happen to your child. What do you think you can do to prevent this from happening?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient&#8217;s mother: I need to chart his peak flow, like you said, and use his medicines accordingly. I need to stick with this.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I think those are very good ideas. It might also help to involve him in charting the peak flow readings and have him remind you if you forget. He&#8217;s old enough to be taking some responsibility.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient&#8217;s mother: OK. That&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist acknowledges the mother&#8217;s feelings and does not attempt to smooth things over and make everything all right. He allows the patient&#8217;s mother to come up with solutions and supports them. Finally, he also interjects that some of the responsibility could be shared by the child.</p>

<p class="indentt">Anger is another emotion that is difficult for most people to confront. We simply want it to stop, and our communication often conveys that. (For a more complete discussion of managing anger, see <a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.) This can backfire. Anger is a response to a blocked goal or some sense of injustice. As with shame and embarrassment, anger is often a substitute for some other feeling (e.g., fear, frustration, hurt), because anger feels more powerful and less helpless or weak than those other feelings. Supportive communication attempts to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other person&#8217;s feelings, help identify ways to reach blocked goals, and support the other person when it seems clear that an injustice has been done.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_153"/><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Fifteen minutes just to throw a few pills in a bottle! I don&#8217;t have all day. All I do is wait on you people! First at the doctor&#8217;s office, now here, and I&#8217;m late for an appointment.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know that all of this can be very frustrating. Would you like to use the phone to let them know you&#8217;re running late for your next appointment, or perhaps pick up your prescription later?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I&#8217;m just tired of waiting. I waited almost an hour past my appointment time in the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I don&#8217;t like that either. We&#8217;re all busy, not just the doctor. I will do my best to get this prescription ready as quickly as I can.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Just hurry.</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist acknowledges the patient&#8217;s feelings but does not take the patient&#8217;s anger personally. The pharmacist offers the patient some options (for reaching a blocked goal) and reassures the patient that she will get the prescription filled as quickly as possible. In addition, the pharmacist offers support (for an injustice) by letting the patient know that she too dislikes it when physicians (and others) don&#8217;t stay on time for their appointments.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="chapter11.xhtml#tab11.1">Table 11-1</a> summarizes this discussion on emotions and supportive communication. Regardless of the feeling expressed, supportive communication attempts to legitimize the other&#8217;s feelings.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORTIVE COMMUNICATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are three major problems associated with supportive communication: (1) no matter what you do or say, the other person can decide to remain angry, indifferent, or uncooperative; (2) defenses resulting from certain situations or conditions can cause patients to displace a core emotion and replace it with anger or indifference at a time when they most need support; and (3) supportive communication takes time, effort, and practice.</p>
<p class="indent">First, it needs to be clear that your job is to demonstrate caring and concern for the patient&#8212;<em>not</em> to solve the patient&#8217;s problems, especially if the problems were created long before your relationship with the patient began. For example, if a patient is running late for an appointment, the pharmacist can help as much as possible by providing care to the patient quickly. However, the pharmacist did not make the patient late and should not accept being chastised by the patient because the <a id="page_154"/>patient is late. Some people, at some times, will not respond to caring and concern no matter how it is demonstrated. At such times it becomes necessary to either move on or, for example, to assertively ask the patient to stop yelling at you. You cannot be made responsible for others&#8217; incivility, regardless of the reason.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, certain illnesses (like depression), some emotions (like shame), and certain conditions (like stigmatization of HIV or AIDS) cause patients to feel so uncomfortable and hurt that they convert this hurt to feeling angry or more withdrawn. They are in great need of social support and supportive communication, yet their own anger, discomfort, or withdrawal evokes discomfort in others (including health care providers) to the point where they respond with anger or avoidance when the patient most needs support and confirmation. Our angry response or withdrawal can exacerbate the patient&#8217;s feelings of isolation. There is no simple solution here. Start by keeping in mind, regardless of the emotional display of the patient, that we can focus on legitimizing feelings and listening carefully without feeling responsible for the patient&#8217;s feelings or condition. This is difficult, but essential.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, the skills we have been discussing require that a certain amount of uninterrupted time be spent with the patient. In some community pharmacy settings, this is difficult. But not using these skills leads to even greater expenditures of time. It takes practice and sensitivity in listening to the patient for these skills to be mastered and used effectively, so patience with yourself is also required.</p>
<h3 class="h3">UNHELPFUL OR UNSUPPORTIVE MESSAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">When interacting with patients who are distressed, health care providers can engage in unhelpful or unsupportive communication by being indifferent or overly concerned or helpful, by not listening carefully, or by trying to fix the problem or the patient. If we intend to truly provide care, indifference is unacceptable when interacting with a distressed patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Being overly concerned can be suffocating to the patient or can exacerbate the patient&#8217;s belief about being weak by admitting to a problem in the first place. When we are overly concerned, it is usually because we are trying to take care of our own needs (the need to be seen as helpful, nice, or good) rather than focusing on what the patient needs. Some patients simply may not be ready for any assistance.</p>
<p class="indent">When we try to fix the problem or the patient, it is usually because we are uncomfortable with the patient or problem and want the patient or the problem to go away as soon as possible. Learning to simply listen and legitimize feelings rather than trying to solve a problem or cheer a patient up will alleviate some of the stress associated with hearing about people&#8217;s problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_155"/>SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Supportive communication is an essential part of building a trusting therapeutic relationship with the patient. For supportive communication to be effective, the pharmacist must listen to the feeling expressed by the patient, be aware of what that feeling results from, and use supportive messages that address the issues that elicited the specific feeling (see <a href="chapter11.xhtml#tab11.1">Table 11-1</a>). This will result in more satisfying and longer-lasting relationships with patients.</p>
