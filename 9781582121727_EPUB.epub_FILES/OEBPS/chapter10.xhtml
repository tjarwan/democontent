<h2 class="h2a"><em>INTERACTING WITH PHYSICIANS</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">With rare exception, the primary reason pharmacists call physicians is that something is wrong or a problem needs to be resolved. Because these calls so often begin with a problem, they can start off in a negative or adversarial way and trigger defensiveness in the physician. But skillful and sensitive pharmacists can turn these negatives into pluses. The provision of pharmaceutical care requires a collaborative relationship with the physician&#8212;a relationship in which egos are set aside (you may not be able to control someone else&#8217;s ego, but you can certainly control your own) and the focus is on preventing and solving drug-related problems with the intent of providing the best possible care for the patient. This means that the focus of any call to the physician (other than those calls that are purely informational) needs to be on assisting the patient and solving or preventing drug-related problems. The relationship must develop out of mutual respect. Calls that are motivated out of a need to &#8220;catch someone&#8221; or prove a point are not conducive to vital professional relationships. This chapter provides guidelines for discussing drug-related problems with physicians.</p>
<h3 class="h3">BUILDING RAPPORT</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can build rapport with physicians <em>before</em> you need to call them about patients&#8217; drug-related problems. Whether you are an independent pharmacy owner or an employee pharmacist, it is important to rethink who you are and what you do. Are you a health care provider? Do you have a practice? Or do you simply see yourself as someone who fills prescriptions? If you do see yourself as a health care provider with a practice, then meeting with local physicians is a vital step in building rapport and allowing you to be more effective in drug therapy decision-making. <a id="page_138"/>As suggested in the book <em>A Practical Guide to Pharmaceutical Care</em>,<sup><a id="ch10-ref1" href="chapter10.xhtml#ch10_ref1">1</a></sup> pharmacists can meet with local physicians to</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Inform them of new service offerings and your desire to work together to benefit patients. It is important to explain the benefit of each new service to physicians in a way that emphasizes what is in it for them. For example, let&#8217;s say that you are going to develop educational services and sessions for asthma patients. Point out to the physician (particularly general practitioners and family practitioners) that you understand how busy they are and know that often they do not have time to be as thorough as they would like. By providing this service and working collaboratively with the physician, you can keep the patient&#8217;s asthma under control so that the patient does not need to switch to a specialist (pulmonologist). One pharmacist sold the idea for a blood pressure monitoring service to a physician on the basis that every 2 weeks he would fax or e-mail the patient&#8217;s readings to the physician, along with brief notes. This way the physician, who saw the patient only every 3 to 6 months, would have better information at his disposal.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Encourage physicians to discuss what services would assist them in their practice.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Discuss changes that are taking place in pharmacy in general that could lead to better care for patients.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Update them on new drug developments within a specialty area or in general. Providing physicians with unbiased information about new products can be very useful from both an efficacy and a cost perspective. It can also elevate your status as a pharmacist and that of the profession.</p>
<p class="indentt">Pharmacists who cannot meet face-to-face with local physicians can send a letter introducing themselves and their new services. The letter can ask physicians to indicate what services they desire and whether they would be willing to meet and discuss these services further. Whether the contact is face-to-face or through a letter, it helps build rapport and credibility and separates you from everyone else.</p>
<h3 class="h3">REASONS FOR CALLING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacists usually contact physicians about the following types of drug-related problems:</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><a id="page_139"/><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Untreated condition(s). The patient needs drug therapy but is not receiving it.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Improper drug selection. In addition to a wrong drug for this patient and indication, improper selection could mean that the patient can&#8217;t afford the drug or is allergic to the drug, that the drug hasn&#8217;t helped or been tolerated in the past, or that the patient has renal or hepatic impairment that makes the drug choice improper.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Dosage too high. The wrong dose, frequency, or duration or a drug interaction could make the dose too high.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Subtherapeutic dosage. This could result from a wrong dose, frequency, or duration; a drug interaction; or storage or administration that lowers the effective dose.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Adverse drug reactions and side effects that cannot be tolerated or won&#8217;t go away. This could result from inappropriate dosing or administration or from drug interactions.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Drug interactions.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Unnecessary drug therapy. This could include drug use without a medical indication, addiction or recreational drug use, situations in which nondrug therapy or no therapy is more appropriate, duplicate therapy, or treating an avoidable adverse reaction to another drug.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Compliance problems. These can occur when the patient cannot tolerate side effects, the cost is too high, the dosage regimen is too frequent or complex, the patient cannot swallow or otherwise administer the drug, the patient does not understand how the drug works or how to take it, or the patient does not understand the need for the drug or the severity of the illness.</p>
<p class="indentt">Other reasons for contacting the physician include</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Inability to read or interpret a prescription order,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Request to change a drug and suggestion for a therapeutic alternative because a product is out of stock, a specific brand is necessary, or the patient can&#8217;t afford, is allergic to, or has not been helped in the past by the prescribed drug,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Refill authorization,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Request for additional information about the patient for your database, and</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Physician detailing or counterdetailing to introduce important new products or new services in your pharmacy.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_140"/>PREPARATION BEFORE CALLING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacist&#8211;physician communication can be frustrating for both parties when the pharmacist has not prepared adequately. Before contacting the physician, you need to consider the following points:</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Have the necessary facts ready, including your recommendation and rationale. These facts include not only drug- and disease-related information but relevant patient information (e.g., the patient cannot afford the drug, can&#8217;t remember to take it, cannot tolerate side effects).</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Have a literature citation ready, if possible (use the Web or hard-copy references).</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Know what you&#8217;re talking about. Don&#8217;t waste a busy physician&#8217;s time. Be succinct and to the point in your communication. Identify yourself (Hi, this is Tina King at The Apothecary), the patient involved (Ruth Jones), the problem (is still getting heartburn and it&#8217;s keeping her up at night), and your recommendation (therefore, I would like to recommend that we switch her from X to Y). Provide any other relevant information (she has taken her X as prescribed and cut down on fatty and spicy food, and she does not eat close to bedtime, yet she is not getting much relief).</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Get sufficient information from the patient (what the problem is as the patient sees it) to be prepared.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Be prepared to use the SOAP approach (subjective and objective information, assessment, and plan), because this is what physicians are accustomed to.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Always have an alternative recommendation ready in case your initial recommendation is not accepted.</p>
<h3 class="h3">COMMUNICATION CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before contacting the physician, consider the following communication strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">The entire focus should be on attacking problems or issues, not people or personalities. Keep the focus of the conversation on solving patient problems, not on pointing out that the drug therapy prescribed is inappropriate. There is a big difference in the following two responses: &#8220;Dr. Smith, Mrs. Jones can&#8217;t use those tablets you prescribed&#8221; and &#8220;Dr. Smith, Mrs. Jones has trouble swallowing. I would like to recommend&#8230;&#8221; The latter is far more likely to elicit cooperation, because it states the problem in terms of Mrs. Jones&#8217;s swallowing difficulties, not what Dr. Smith did. For another example, rather than saying, &#8220;You <a id="page_141"/>shouldn&#8217;t have prescribed X because Mrs. Jones is taking Y and the two drugs interact,&#8221; say, &#8220;Because Mrs. Jones is already taking Y, I&#8217;m concerned about her getting X because of the drug interaction. I suggest we use Z instead for the following reasons&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Make sure professional boundaries are respected; this goes both ways. Don&#8217;t try to play doctor, and don&#8217;t second-guess the doctor. Ask questions and show interest in the patient, not in being right.</p>
<p class="indent">Mentally and emotionally prepare for different consequences. What will you say if you are met with resistance, anger, belligerence, attempts at intimidation, or refusal? To what extent are you willing to persist and not back down?</p>
<p class="indent">Use a combination of information exchange, assertiveness, and effective listening. Make sure that you listen completely to the physician&#8217;s rationale for the decisions made. Repeat back your understanding, and be prepared to offer an alternative in a confident, assertive, nonjudgmental manner.</p>
<p class="indent">For telephone communication, be prepared to talk to a nurse or member of the office staff. You may need to assert yourself if you need to speak to the physician. Think about what conditions would necessitate talking directly to the physician.</p>
<p class="indent">Use 4F communication: &#8220;I know how you <em>f</em>eel. I <em>f</em>elt the same way, too. But I <em>f</em>ound in the literature&#8230;,&#8221; and stay <em>f</em>ocused on the problem.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="chapter10.xhtml#tab10.1">Table 10-1</a> provides guidelines for contacting physicians in person and by telephone. Two sample dialogues about the same drug therapy problem are given at the end of the chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3">CONTINGENCIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">When a physician refuses to take your recommendation to change an order, don&#8217;t continue to argue. Simply tell the patient what happened. Identify alternatives, if possible. When a patient may be harmed by inappropriate therapy and the physician refuses to change the order, state, &#8220;Dr. Jones, I cannot in good conscience give Ms. Brown this medication, because I believe it is harmful to her. I will not dispense it. Again, I recommend (name of medication). If this is not acceptable, I will simply explain to her why I cannot dispense the (name of medication).&#8221; Don&#8217;t attempt, in any way to make the physician look bad to the patient, even if you are correct about your recommendation. You can only lose in such an interchange. Stick with the facts, what you told the physician, what you recommended, and what you think should be done now.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_143"/>INVOLVING THE PATIENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">In general, whenever a physician needs to be contacted about a problem with a patient&#8217;s drug therapy, the patient should be involved. However, we have to be careful not to jeopardize the physician&#8211;patient relationship. For example, a patient is prescribed an appetite suppressant by a physician who does not know the patient has high blood pressure. It is important to inform the patient that you need to call the physician treating her high blood pressure to discuss this new medication, and the reason for the call. Emphasize that you understand that the prescriber did not realize she has high blood pressure. Consider what you would do if the patient asked you not to call her physician because she didn&#8217;t want to bother him and told you that she would talk to her doctor. If she insisted on this, it would be important to not dispense any medication that could harm her and to put in writing what the problem is and what solution you propose. Make a copy for the patient and keep a copy in your files. In this way, your communication to the patient won&#8217;t be communicated to the physician incorrectly or incompletely.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PULLING THINGS TOGETHER</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now let&#8217;s take a look at two pharmacist&#8211;physician dialogues about the same problem. These dialogues indicate how preparation, focus, and interpersonal skills can make a great deal of difference.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 1</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Yeah, doc, the amoxicillin you prescribed for Mrs. Tanner&#8217;s kid is not working. We need to get her something else.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Physician: Who is this?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Joe at Conners Drugs&#8212;the pharmacist.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Physician: What do you mean it&#8217;s not working? Did she give it to the child correctly? He&#8217;s only been taking it for 5 or 6 days. She has a 10-day supply. Is the child still running a fever?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I guess she&#8217;s giving it to him right. She says he&#8217;s not feeling good and she wants to give him something else. I didn&#8217;t ask about a fever.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Physician: Tell her to call me. I&#8217;ll take care of it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You got it, doc!</p>
<p class="page">&#160;</p>
<h4 class="h4" style="margin-top:0em;"><a id="page_144"/>Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist was not prepared. He simply didn&#8217;t do his homework before he called. In addition, he defined the problem as the drug prescribed by the physician. The problem is that the patient was not getting better (as defined by the mother). The pharmacist did not have clear information to support the contention that there was a problem. As a result, the physician decided to talk to the patient directly rather than waste any more time talking to an ill-prepared pharmacist. This conversation reflects poorly on the individual pharmacist and the profession.</p>
<p class="indent">Let&#8217;s look at how this might have been approached.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Hi, Dr. Smith. This is Sara Thomas, a pharmacist at Conners Drugs. I just got off the phone with Susan Tanner, Brady&#8217;s mother. She called because she was concerned about Brady. His fever is still at 101.5 and he has been taking the amoxicillin for 6 days now, three times a day as you prescribed. She said he&#8217;s pretty miserable. I assumed that Brady has otitis because she talked about his ear infection and I saw from his medication record that he was treated for otitis once before, about 3 months ago. I think it might be time to go to trimethoprim&#8211;sulfamethoxazole twice a day or cefaclor every 8 to 12 hours.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Physician: So he&#8217;s still running a fever. From what you have said it sounds like he&#8217;s not responding to the amoxicillin. OK, give him the trimethoprim&#8211;sulfamethoxazole twice a day. Do you have his weight?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Sure do.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Physician: Good. Let&#8217;s keep him on it for 10 days.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: OK. I&#8217;ll let Mrs. Tanner know.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Physician: Thanks for calling.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You&#8217;re welcome. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist was well prepared and kept her focus on the problem. She gave the physician more than one option and, as a result of her thoroughness, the physician was able to make a decision quickly. Although <a id="page_145"/>all situations may not go as smoothly, they are far more likely to go this way with preparation and appropriate focus.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is often uncomfortable for pharmacists to call physicians, since the nature of the call is that there is a problem. Well-prepared, skilled pharmacists who focus on patient problems rather than on prescribing problems can turn these calls into opportunities for professional collaboration and cooperation, rather than conflict.</p>
