<h2 class="h2a"><em>COMMUNICATING ON SENSITIVE TOPICS</em></h2>
<p class="chapauthor">Kimberly Braxton Lloyd and Bruce A. Berger</p>
<p class="noindent">Certain problems may be especially hard for patients to discuss with their health care providers. Patients may find it difficult to discuss their concerns about sexual performance, mood disorders, substance abuse, or even obesity. Ethnicity and gender can be factors in patients&#8217; hesitancy to communicate about these issues. For example, some men find it difficult to discuss male factor infertility because they believe it reflects on their masculinity, and this difficulty can be exaggerated in cultures where masculinity, virility, fertility, and offspring are highly valued. In contrast, some women who are experiencing infertility readily seek health care advice and often ask their pharmacist for assistance with ovulation prediction devices, vitamins, supplements, and pregnancy tests.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of their accessibility in the community and frequent interaction with clients, pharmacists have many opportunities to discuss sensitive topics with their patients. By creating a safe and caring environment for their patients, they can assist those who are embarrassed or hesitant to initiate dialogue with a health care professional. Some pharmacists may feel unprepared, uncertain, and uncomfortable in these situations, however. This chapter offers guidance on how to engage patients in dialogue about sensitive health issues.</p>
<h3 class="h3">CHOOSING THE TIME AND PLACE</h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most important factors to consider in preparing to discuss sensitive health issues with a patient is ensuring an appropriate time and place for this communication. First, the pharmacist should select a time when he or she can devote full attention to the patient without interruption. It takes time to build trust and to delve into sensitive topics. <a id="page_214"/>If the pharmacist is called away to care for another patient in the middle of this discussion, the patient may feel that he or she is not important to the pharmacist and may withdraw from communication. The pharmacist should plan ahead in order to minimize disruptions during the discussion. This includes taking everything that might be needed to the counseling area (e.g., the medication being dispensed, patient education materials, physical assessment tools, medical record, pharmacy profile, pen and paper, laptop computer). Other pharmacy personnel should be aware of the importance of privacy during the discussion and should be told how long the pharmacist expects to spend with the patient. It may be helpful to use a printed sign, door flag system, or other means of indicating that the counseling area is in use and an interview is in progress. Keep in mind that the discussion does not have to occur at the time the medication is dispensed. It may be necessary and useful to schedule an appointment at a later time when the pharmacist can more fully discuss concerns the patient may have.</p>
<p class="indent">It is essential to have a private environment that minimizes the risk that the discussion will be overheard. A private examination room or counseling area is ideal, but another area of the pharmacy that is isolated from the workflow can be used. If the room used for counseling has windows, it may be helpful to close the blinds (after asking the patient&#8217;s permission to do so) to ensure privacy. If there are no blinds, the pharmacist should position the chairs in a way that minimizes distractions from the pharmacy and maximizes privacy for the patient. The environment should be such that the patient can have the pharmacist&#8217;s undivided attention. The pharmacist should be sensitive to the volume of the conversation, speaking loudly enough to be easily understood without risking a breach in confidentiality. Maintaining eye contact can help the pharmacist adjust the volume and tone of the discussion to put the patient at ease. Patients often become emotional when discussing sensitive issues, so tissues should be available in the counseling area. Before beginning the discussion, the pharmacist should make sure the patient is comfortable with the setting.</p>
<h3 class="h3">INITIATING THE INTERVIEW</h3>
<p class="noindent">If this is the first meeting with the patient, the pharmacist should initiate introductions and establish the goals of the appointment&#8212;in particular, what the patient would like to accomplish. The pharmacist should maintain a professional demeanor throughout the interview and be polite, respectful, and engaged. The patient may become more reserved and hesitate to disclose private health issues or concerns if the discussion is too informal, the communication style is too casual, or a professional patient&#8211;provider relationship is not maintained.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_215"/>The pharmacist should listen carefully to the patient. Eye contact is important. It may be necessary to take notes for the medical record, but this should be done intermittently throughout the discussion to minimize distractions. Writing while the patient is talking could be interpreted as inattention or lack of interest. It is a good idea to tell the patient at the outset that you will be documenting the appointment in the medical record, in order to avoid concern about what you are writing and why. A patient who is not expecting you to take notes may feel self-conscious about what he or she has said that prompted you to write. For instance, if the patient has just disclosed that she has been diagnosed with herpes and she suspects that her husband has been unfaithful, this is not the ideal time to document the new diagnosis in the chart. Writing at this point could cause open communication to end and the pharmacist to miss an opportunity for educating the patient about the disease and the medications prescribed to treat it. Instead, the pharmacist should avoid acting surprised or embarrassed, maintain eye contact, and listen intently to the patient&#8217;s concerns. It is important to respond empathically to the patient&#8217;s distress without making a judgment about the circumstances (e.g., &#8220;This sounds like a very difficult and stressful situation for you&#8221;).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, to maximize open communication, pharmacists must be well prepared to evaluate the condition and provide relevant patient education. It is important to be professional, confident, and caring when engaging patients. If the pharmacist lacks confidence and hesitates, flushes, stutters, loses eye contact, or sounds unsure about what to ask or say next, he or she can send the wrong signal to the patient. The patient may think the pharmacist is surprised or embarrassed by the topic or is being judgmental. Thus, the pharmacist should prepare for the discussion in an organized manner. This might include reviewing the disease and pharmacotherapy options, considering any diseases or medications that might cause or worsen the patient&#8217;s symptoms, and reviewing important counseling points on the disease and medications. It might be helpful to make a mental or written outline for the interview or write a list of questions to use. <a href="chapter16.xhtml#tab16.1">Table 16-1</a> gives some examples of interview questions. The pharmacist should ask mostly open-ended questions, ask follow-up questions to encourage thoughtful responses, and make reflective, nonjudgmental statements (e.g., &#8220;You have found many of these physical changes to be distressing&#8221;).</p>
<h3 class="h3">SHOWING EMPATHY</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to predict the multitude of emotions a patient may be experiencing in regard to a sensitive health issue, and these feelings are likely to surface during an interview. For instance, men who have erectile dysfunction (ED) often experience embarrassment, shame, isolation, and inadequacy, all of which are barriers to communication. Patients with depression may fear the social stigma of mental illness and be afraid to discuss their symptoms. Patients with fibromyalgia may fear that their diagnosis will not be taken seriously. They may feel frustrated, angry, discouraged, or hopeless.</p>

</table>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_218"/>Regardless of the emotions displayed during an interview, it is important to show empathy in communicating with the patient. For example, a comment such as &#8220;It must be very difficult to function at work when you are not able to sleep at night&#8221; may be effective. It indicates that you have heard what the patient is describing and understand the potential impact on the patient&#8217;s life. If the pharmacist does not know what to say, repeating the patient&#8217;s own words, verbatim&#8212;for example, &#8220;You feel lonely and isolated since you moved to this new town&#8221;&#8212;can be very effective. Try not to discount or minimize anything the patient says, and resist the temptation to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, everything will be OK.&#8221; A statement like this minimizes the patient&#8217;s distress and can make the patient feel alienated. A better response is to convey to the patient that his or her concerns are respected and important.</p>
<p class="indent">When a patient presents a problem, there is a natural tendency for the health care provider to immediately jump in to solve or minimize the problem instead of attending to how the patient feels about it. Let&#8217;s look at dialogues with two patients; the first shows inappropriate responses by the pharmacist, and the second shows more effective responses.</p>
<h4 class="h4">ED Dialogue 1</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient (to clerk): Could I talk to the pharmacist?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Clerk: Sure. (yells back to pharmacist) This guy wants to talk to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist (from the prescription area to the patient, who is 20 feet away): Yeah, what is it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (motions to the pharmacist to come forward): I need to speak to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist (rolls eyes and comes down to patient): Yes?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (hands over prescription): I&#8217;m a little embarrassed about this.<br/>I feel bad that I even have to use this. Is it really gonna work for me?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Oh sure&#8230;yeah&#8230;don&#8217;t worry! Lots of guys come in for this. I&#8217;ll get it filled for you right away. Don&#8217;t you worry. Be glad there is something you can use to help you.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_219"/>Patient: It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s been a while since my wife and I have been intimate, and I hate it that I have to rely on a drug to&#8230;to&#8230;you know.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Yeah, I know, but hey, like I said, at least there&#8217;s a drug to help you out. So let me go and I&#8217;ll get this filled right away.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (sheepishly): OK.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist does not do anything that is blatantly wrong, but his approach is to quickly address the patient&#8217;s concerns and move on. He does not really address those concerns, however. This is probably because the pharmacist is uncomfortable discussing this subject. In addition, the patient is left feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable. By yelling back to the pharmacist, the clerk furthers the patient&#8217;s embarrassment and discomfort, and the patient feels even more exposed. Let&#8217;s look now at how this might have been handled more appropriately.</p>
<h4 class="h4">ED Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient (to clerk): Could I talk to the pharmacist?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Clerk: Sure. (walks back to the pharmacist) The man at the counter would like to talk to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist (walks to the patient from the dispensing area): Hello, I&#8217;m Ken Brown, the pharmacist. How may I help you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (hands over prescription): I&#8217;m a little embarrassed about this. I feel bad that I even have to use this. Is it really gonna work for me?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist (looks at the prescription): Let&#8217;s go over here where we can talk more privately (motions patient to a quiet area of the store). It can be awkward and uncomfortable to talk about things like this. Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to accept that this is happening and you need medication to be able to do something that used to be very natural to you as a man.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, I don&#8217;t like it at all.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I see that. This drug has been shown to be very effective in helping men get an erection. Did your doctor rule out any health problems that may be contributing to this?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_220"/>Patient: Yes, he was very thorough. He just said that sometimes men my age don&#8217;t get enough blood flow, so they have problems.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s correct, and it is more common than most men realize. This medicine will help to get the proper blood flow to the penis so you can get an erection when you are aroused.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I just feel sort of&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You don&#8217;t like needing to depend on a drug to get an erection.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yeah&#8230;I want to have a normal sex life, but I don&#8217;t like that I have to use a drug to have one.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s very understandable. Doesn&#8217;t feel quite natural to you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I am glad we have something that can help you and is fairly simple to use. I&#8217;ll go ahead and fill this, and then we&#8217;ll discuss how to get the most benefit from the medication and any precautions you may need to know.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK. Thanks again.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist shows insight and understanding. He conveys to the patient that he understands what the patient is feeling and why he is feeling that way. This builds the relationship and makes for more open discussion of the clinical issue. It also helps the patient see this discussion as an extension of the pharmacist&#8217;s care and compassion, rather than just information given to correct or fix how the patient is feeling.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, not only does the clerk not yell across the store, but the pharmacist approaches the patient and then offers a more private area when he understands the nature of the patient&#8217;s concerns. The pharmacist does not try to fix the problem or minimize it. He simply reflects back his understanding of what the problem means to the patient. Being empathic takes courage; you take the risk of reflecting back your understanding and being more intimate with another human being. Ultimately, though, empathy often is very soothing and allows people to move forward and not remain stuck in the problem or the feelings they are having.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_221"/>Another sensitive situation in which empathy is very important is when the patient has a chronic illness that is not life threatening. The health care provider may be tempted to downplay the importance of this condition or try to convince the patient that &#8220;it could be worse.&#8221; However, it is important to consider that although the condition is not fatal, it may significantly affect the patient&#8217;s quality of life. One example is psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis often experience pain, suffering, sleep disturbances, and mood changes. If the psoriasis lesions are visible and hard to conceal, the patient may experience embarrassment and fear of social stigma. One common communication mistake is to diminish the significance of a chronic disorder like this by comparing it with a &#8220;more serious,&#8221; life-threatening health problem for the purpose of &#8220;making the patient feel better.&#8221; This should be avoided, because it belittles the impact of the disease on the patient&#8217;s quality of life. Expressing understanding of the patient&#8217;s discomfort and embarrassment, showing empathy, and providing the patient with a treatment plan would be more helpful. (See <a href="chapter4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a> for more on empathy.) Now, let&#8217;s look at another patient scenario for practice. Again, we will first examine an inappropriate way to respond to the patient, then a more appropriate way.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Psoriasis Dialogue 1</h4>
<p class="noindent">Your patient is Mrs. Smith. She is 25 years old and has chronic plaque psoriasis, which is isolated to her hands. According to the clinical classification system, this would be defined as mild psoriasis because such a small area of the body is involved. However, the lesions on her hands are highly visible, and they cause Mrs. Smith extreme embarrassment. Your communication strategy should take into consideration her personal concerns.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I feel so self-conscious about how my hands look. They look terrible. My husband is afraid to hold my hand because he&#8217;s afraid of catching this. Plus, he says my hands look gross.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Oh, it&#8217;s not so bad. You tell him I said that he can&#8217;t get this from you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: It&#8217;s terrible to me.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Mrs. Smith, it could be so much worse. It&#8217;s not life threatening and it&#8217;s only on your hands.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (in disbelief): Only on my hands? That&#8217;s not bad enough?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_222"/>Pharmacist: Some patients have this all over their body. Be thankful you only have it on your hands.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (sarcastically): Thanks! That makes me feel so much better. Obviously, I have no right to complain. Just give me my medicine.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist minimizes the importance of the problem to Mrs. Smith. She is embarrassed and hurt, yet the pharmacist acknowledges none of this. While everything the pharmacist says may be true, it lacks caring and compassion. A better way of responding is as follows.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Psoriasis Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I feel so self-conscious about how my hands look. They look terrible. My husband is afraid to hold my hand because he&#8217;s afraid of catching this. Plus, he says my hands look gross.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I can see that this is all very hurtful to you. It must be difficult to feel rejected in that way.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: It is awful.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I see that. You can tell your husband that he cannot get this from you. It&#8217;s not contagious. I know that doesn&#8217;t make you feel better, but he should know that.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I just want it to go away.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know. I&#8217;ll get your prescription filled, and then we will talk about how to use your medication properly to get the most benefit from it, to help clear up your hands.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist acknowledges the patient&#8217;s feelings of hurt and embarrassment. It is noteworthy that the pharmacist does not take sides; she simply empathizes with the patient, provides some useful information for the husband, and responds to the patient&#8217;s desire to eradicate the problem.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_223"/>ASSESSING PATIENT READINESS</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is important to assess a patient&#8217;s readiness to discuss a sensitive topic or to take action to treat an illness. Some patients are well aware of their health condition and the risks and treatment options associated with the problem but are not ready to discuss it or take action. For instance, some patients do not want to discuss their obesity, tobacco abuse, or alcoholism. Other patients may be willing to discuss a health problem but are not ready to do all that is needed to control it. For example, a patient with high blood pressure may be ready to take the prescribed medication but not ready to quit smoking. If the health care provider&#8217;s communication strategy does not match the patient&#8217;s level of readiness for each behavior, it will not be effective. One technique for ensuring a match is assessing and addressing decisional balance.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of decisional balance is that patients must perceive the benefits of changing a behavior (such as taking a medication, losing weight, stopping smoking, or exercising) to be greater than the barriers before they will make the change. The pharmacist can have an important role in helping patients tip this balance toward change. Keep in mind that when patients are ambivalent or unsure about whether they really need to change a behavior, their perception is that the benefits of the change are equal to the barriers. Reciting the list of benefits to the patient often forces the patient to respond defensively with the list of barriers. This approach is seldom effective. A better approach is to ask patients what they perceive to be the benefits of the proposed change. This way the patient focuses on the benefits instead of the barriers, engaging in self-reflection. (See <a href="chapter9.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a> for more on behavioral change.) In these situations, the pharmacist should not try to persuade the patient to change. (See <a href="chapter13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a> for more on persuasiveness.) Now, let&#8217;s look at a dialogue that illustrates how to tip the decisional balance for patients who are ambivalent or resistant to making a change.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I just don&#8217;t know about taking this medicine for my high blood pressure. I feel just fine.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: So, because you feel OK you are having some doubts about whether you really need the medication. (responding with empathy and understanding)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Right.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s understandable. It is quite common that people with high blood pressure feel OK even though their blood pressure is elevated. What do you see as the possible benefits of taking the medicine?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_224"/>Patient: Well, I guess it&#8217;s supposed to lower my blood pressure to reduce my risk of a stroke or a heart attack.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s exactly right. May I suggest some additional benefits? (respecting the patient&#8217;s autonomy by asking permission to provide additional information)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: By lowering your blood pressure, you can lead a more normal life. For example, I know that you like to jog. It is important to get your blood pressure down <em>before</em> you exercise vigorously, since exercise can raise your blood pressure. We want you to continue exercising, but we want it to be safe for you.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I see. I hadn&#8217;t thought of that.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: What barriers do you see to taking the medicine?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, as I said, I feel OK, but you said you can feel OK when your blood pressure is up.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Right. Would it help if we took your blood pressure here to see where it is?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Sure.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: OK, we can do that. What other barriers might keep you from taking the medicine?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I&#8217;ve heard that it can make you feel sluggish or dizzy.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That&#8217;s a legitimate concern. Some patients feel a little sluggish until their bodies get used to the medicine. Also, when you first start taking it, you might feel a little lightheaded when you first sit up in the morning. These problems usually go away after about a week on the medicine. It is best to see how the medicine will affect you. Getting up and out of bed slowly in the morning will help. How does that sound?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK. But, I&#8217;ve also heard that some men have &#8220;male problems&#8221; with some of these medicines. Is that true?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Having trouble getting an erection occurs in very few males, and usually the problem subsides in about a week. If the problem <a id="page_225"/>persists, call and let me know, and we can ask your doctor to either adjust your dose or choose another medicine. The problem is completely reversible when the medication is stopped.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Why would he give me something that could do that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know this concerns you. As I said, this side effect does not occur very often, and the medicine is very effective in lowering blood pressure.</p>
<p class="indentt">In this dialogue, the pharmacist respectfully addresses the patient&#8217;s concerns, provides information after asking permission, and addresses barriers to taking the medicine. The same approach can be taken in discussing exercise and diet. First, the benefits are explored and then barriers are addressed. In discussing exercise, keep in mind that many patients think exercise means something quite rigorous. Suggest walking, parking farther from the building where the patient works, and taking the stairs instead of the elevator; these are also forms of exercise that the patient may not have considered.</p>
<p class="indent">When you discuss the barriers to making a change, it is best to ask for the patient&#8217;s thoughts about how he or she might overcome those barriers. Any solutions a patient comes up with are likely to be far more effective than suggestions you may have that might not fit the patient&#8217;s lifestyle. If the patient gets stuck, it is appropriate to say, &#8220;May I suggest how other patients have dealt with this barrier?&#8221; Next, describe the solutions, and then ask, &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; or &#8220;Which of these solutions would work for you?&#8221; This helps the patient make a commitment to change.</p>
<h3 class="h3">APPROACHING SENSITIVE TOPICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacists have multiple opportunities for discussing with their patients sensitive issues related to the patient&#8217;s medical condition (<a href="#tab16.2">Table 16-2</a>). The key is to be observant and engaged.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, a patient experiencing a sensitive health problem might seek alternative therapies to treat his or her condition in an effort to avoid making a medical appointment for the problem. A man with ED or infertility might explore herbal therapies to improve virility. Women experiencing menopause might shop for black cohosh, soy isoflavones, or vaginal lubricants. Patients with depression might ask for more information on St. John&#8217;s wort. Each of these situations provides an opportunity for the pharmacist to discuss the pattern of symptoms the patient is experiencing and initiate a discussion of the condition and treatment options.</p>

<p class="indentt">Alternatively, a pharmacist who notices that a patient has a medical condition predisposing him to a specific disorder might initiate dialogue with the patient. For instance, the pharmacist might initiate a discussion about ED upon noting that the patient has a medical condition that increases the risk of sexual dysfunction. The patient might not be aware that diabetes or hypertension increases the risk of impaired sexual performance. The pharmacist can help by recommending interventions to improve the patient&#8217;s overall health and by reinforcing the importance of medication compliance to optimize blood glucose and blood pressure control.</p>
<p class="indent">Another opportunity may present itself when a patient refills a medication. This is a good chance to assess whether the medication is causing or worsening a medical condition that the patient might be reluctant to discuss (such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or mood changes). If the patient is experiencing an unwanted effect, the pharmacist can make a recommendation to the patient&#8217;s prescriber.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, an obvious opportunity to engage a patient in discussion arises when the patient is prescribed a medication to treat an illness about which he or she may be sensitive (e.g., HIV/AIDS, a sexually transmitted infection, cancer, sexual dysfunction, infertility, psychiatric <a id="page_227"/>illness). In this situation, the pharmacist can initiate a dialogue in one of the following ways:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;I would like to talk to you about your new prescription to ensure that it will be effective for you. I know that this may not be easy to discuss, but I would like to answer any questions you may have at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;What has your doctor already told you about this condition and how this medicine will help?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;What questions do you have, now that you have a prescription to treat this health condition?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;I am going to tell you what you need to know about this medicine. If you have any questions, please ask. I want you to be as informed as possible.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacists can be an important source of information for patients who are experiencing sensitive health problems. By being attentive to patients&#8217; questions and other cues, pharmacists can identify opportunities to engage patients in discussion. Pharmacists can also engage patients when counseling them about new medications used to treat these health disorders, as well as during follow-up monitoring for safety and efficacy of medications known to cause potentially sensitive side effects. In communicating with patients about these issues, it is important to respect privacy, listen carefully, be attentive, and show empathy.</p>

How might a patient&#8217;s ability to absorb information be affected by an aloof, indifferent, judgmental, or uncomfortable health care provider?</p>
