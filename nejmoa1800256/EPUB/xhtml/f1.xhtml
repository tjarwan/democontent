            Variables outside Target Ranges, among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes, as Compared

            <div role="paragraph">Hazard ratios show the excess risk of each outcome among patients with type 2 diabetes,
               as compared with matched controls from the general population, according to age categories
               and to the number of risk-factor variables (scale, none to five) that were outside
               target ranges currently recommended in guidelines. The analysis included patients
               with type 2 diabetes and controls matched for age, sex, and county in Sweden. We constructed
               a Cox hazards model for each age category, and these models were adjusted for the
               covariable “category”; this covariable denotes the number of risk-factor variables
               that were within target ranges. These Cox model analyses were performed on five imputed
               data sets for each age category, and hazard ratios were pooled from all the data sets
               with the use of Rubin’s rule.
