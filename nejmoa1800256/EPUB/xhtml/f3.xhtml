            Cholesterol and Death from Any Cause, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Heart
            Failure in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
            <div role="paragraph">We constructed a Cox model for each outcome and applied a prediction function to assess
               the relationship between glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood-pressure, and LDL cholesterol
               levels and the risks of death from any cause (Panel A), acute myocardial infarction
               (Panel B), stroke (Panel C), and hospitalization for heart failure (Panel D). Reference
               values were the contemporary guideline levels: 53 mmol per mole for the glycated hemoglobin
               level, 140 mm Hg for the systolic blood pressure, and 2.5 mmol per liter (97 mg per
               deciliter) for the LDL cholesterol level. The dark lines indicate the hazard function,
               and the shaded areas 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables were modeled with
               restricted cubic splines, whereas all the categorical variables were stratified. This
               analysis was restricted to patients with type 2 diabetes. To convert values for cholesterol
               to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.02586.
