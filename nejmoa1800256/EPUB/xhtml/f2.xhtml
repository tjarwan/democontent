            <div role="paragraph">The estimated explained relative risk (i.e., relative importance) shows the strength
               of the association for various risk-factor variables (with values outside the target
               ranges) for predicting death (Panel A), acute myocardial infarction (Panel B), stroke
               (Panel C), and hospitalization for heart failure (Panel D) among patients with type
               2 diabetes. Results were obtained from the first imputed data set; there were no significant
               differences between the sets. The analysis was restricted to patients with type 2
               diabetes. We constructed a Cox hazard model for each outcome, which included every
               predictor. We then constructed a separate Cox model for each predictor and permutated
               covariables from each of these Cox models to estimate the explained relative risk
               (R<sup>2</sup>). R<sup>2</sup> was generated by developed applications for the Cox model and is bounded between
               0 and 1. Risk factors showing a clear and substantial R<sup>2</sup> measure, as compared with other adjacent predictors, are considered to be relevant.
               Full definitions of the risk factors and the values that were considered to be outside
               the target ranges are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height
               in meters. LDL denotes low-density lipoprotein, and GFR glomerular filtration rate.
