            <strong>Figure 1. Illustration of computer-based cognitive-motor integration task.</strong>
            The green circle denotes the central home target in which all movements begin. A red target
            appears in one of four peripheral directions (90° to top, bottom, left or right of center)
            after 4000 ms which serves as the &#x2018;Go&#x2019; cue. <strong>(A)</strong> The standard condition, in
            which eye and arm movements are congruent (moved to the same peripheral target).
            <strong>(B)</strong> The non-standard condition, in which vision and movement are decoupled
            due to a plane dissociation (eyes look at vertical screen while hand moves along horizontal
            screen), and visual feedback reversal (cursor movement 180° rotated from hand motion).
