            <strong>Figure 3. Significant kinematic variables.</strong> <strong>(A)</strong> Mean
            reaction time for healthy controls (yellow) and concussion history participants (blue) in
            both the standard and non-standard condition. Repeated mixed-model ANOVA revealed a
            statistically significant main effect of condition, group, and a group by condition
            interaction. <strong>(B)</strong> Mean constant error (accuracy) for healthy controls
            (yellow) and concussion history participants (blue) in both the standard and non-standard
            condition. Repeated mixed-model ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of
            condition and group, but not a group by condition interaction (p &gt; 0.05).
