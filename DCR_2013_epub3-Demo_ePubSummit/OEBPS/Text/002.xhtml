    <p>Ending poverty is an international priority that cannot be put on the back burner. Although we have halved the proportion of people living in poverty, achieving the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG), our job is far from complete. Today, 1.2&#160;billion people are still living in poverty. It is therefore critical that the global community take further steps by&#160;2015 and beyond to achieve the overarching goal of eradicating poverty completely and enduringly: we must get to zero and stay there.</p>

    <p>The <cite>OECD Development Co-operation Report</cite> (DCR)&#160;2013 provides leaders with analysis and recommendations on how to end one of the world’s most pressing and important problems. Poverty does not stop at hunger; its effects are far reaching and go well beyond how much people eat and how much they earn. It is a multidimensional problem that impacts the well-being of citizens and the health of economies worldwide. It crosses local and national borders and, while it is prevalent, no society will function properly. We need to end poverty and empower the impoverished now.</p>

    <p>In order to do this, we need to alter the way we fight poverty. The world, its actors and its challenges have changed since the development of the MDGs and their adoption in&#160;2001. The geography of poverty has, and is, shifting with a growing quantity of people in middle-income countries, including India and China, living in poverty. The number and diversity of actors in development is increasing, global interdependencies are growing, and inequalities are on the rise despite periods of economic growth.</p>

    <p>These trends call for broader measures that address poverty and development not only as a question of income, but also of inequality, sustainability, inclusiveness and well-being. These measures must be owned and led by countries, based on their respective development paths, priorities, capabilities and processes. This means revisiting our global development goals to ensure they respond to today’s needs and realities.</p>

    <p>The OECD stands ready to contribute to shaping such a framework. Our evidence-based policy analysis, peer review and knowledge sharing support countries in designing better policies to achieve better lives. The Organisation’s expertise and experience in measuring results and strengthening statistical capacities with indicators can make a solid contribution, helping governments put in place the measurable goals that will make empirical sense in supporting policy reforms that will work today and for future generations.</p>

    <p>Although the MDGs rallied unprecedented political and popular will behind the challenge of ending poverty, it was not enough. Poverty eradication –&#160;including its broader elements like exclusion and marginalisation, vulnerability, and safety nets to prevent re-impoverishment&#160;– needs to remain at the heart of both development co-operation policies and programmes and of other global policies.</p>

    <p>There is no single solution. Ending poverty calls for the entire global community to work together –&#160;North-South, public and private sectors, civil society and foundations, and national, regional and local actors&#160;– to satisfy multiple and interlocking needs, demands and issues. The numerous experts from around the world who have contributed to this 2013&#160;edition of the <span class="normal">OECD Development Co-operation Report</span> make this clear.</p>

    <p>This report provides valuable analysis and guidance regarding what we can –&#160;and must&#160;– do to address the biggest challenge of our century: finishing the unfinished business of ending poverty.</p>
