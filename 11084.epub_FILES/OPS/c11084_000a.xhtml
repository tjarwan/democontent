<p class="paraaftertitle">There are of course many individuals, past and present, to whom I owe inspiration and gratitude. Among them are Peter Reason, Brian Goodwin, Alan Rayner, and Chris Clarke, all of whom provided encouragement and feedback when this material was still a work in progress. In more recent years, many people contributed to my thinking on this subject, and dialogue with them has been most helpful; I particularly want to acknowledge Ludwig Jaskolla, Phil Goff, Gordon Globus, Bill Seager, Riccardo Manzotti, Giulio Tononi, Pierfrancesco Basile, Michael Blamauer, and Galen Strawson.</p>
<p>A special acknowledgment goes to my great friend, mentor, and peerless source of inspiration, Henryk Skolimowski.</p></body></html>
