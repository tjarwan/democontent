<h2><a id="S1"/>1.1&#x2003;<a id="d2e91"/>The Importance of Panpsychism</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Few topics in the history of philosophy have proved as persistently inscrutable as the mind. In many ways, we scarcely know more than the ancient Greeks did. The brain, of course, is much better understood today, as are most aspects of human physiology. Physically speaking, our knowledge has expanded greatly. Mentally speaking, though, our progress has been much less impressive. We have many new, intricate philosophical concepts and tools at our disposal, and yet philosophers of mind seem unable to reach any substantial consensus about what the mind is, or how it is related to the body. The enigmatic nature of mind is so pervasive and so compelling that some current philosophers have given up on the problem, calling it intractable or unsolvable in principle. Even granting this, philosophy of mind will not cease. We will continue to inquire into its nature&#x2014;<i>our</i> nature&#x2014;and thus will continue to examine one of the fundamental riddles of existence.</p>
<p>The many difficulties surrounding the concept of mind seem to call for a deep reexamination of the entire situation. I begin with two basic assumptions that are held by nearly all present-day theorists: (1) that mind is limited to humans and perhaps &#x201C;the higher animals,&#x201D; and (2) that mind is somehow dependent on or reducible to the physical substrate of the brain.<a id="FN1a"/><a href="#FN1"><sup>1</sup></a> Point 1 is usually taken for granted and rarely argued for, even though there are intrinsic difficulties with establishing, for example, what exactly constitutes a &#x201C;higher animal&#x201D; and how we can know that only they have minds. Point 2 implies a belief that there is something fundamentally, ontologically unique about the brains of higher animals, and that they alone among all the physical structures of the universe can support mental processes. This second point seems reasonable at first glance, but upon reflection is almost inconceivable; we have not a trace of a theory that would account for such a situation, and there is no physiological data that would support it. Certainly there are unique physical characteristics of the human brain, among them the number and density of neural cells, the modes of input for sensory information, and the language-processing centers. These factors most likely account for our uniquely human mental capabilities, including our powers of abstract reasoning, our ability to experience rich emotions and feelings, to hold complex beliefs, and the like. But we have found nothing so unique as to account for the presence of a mind in humans alone. In any case, what is at issue here is not the nature of the uniquely human mental capabilities, but rather a general understanding of the phenomenon of mind in its broadest sense.</p>
<p>Many thinkers, past and present, have seen fit to challenge these two assumptions. On the basis of their philosophical reasoning, intuitive insights, and investigations into the natural world, they came to reject such assumptions as largely groundless and unjustifiable. They saw no compelling reason to limit mind or mental capacities to humans and higher animals. On the contrary, they found justification for seeing mind in the lower animals, plants, microbes, and even the inorganic realm. On such a view, mind becomes a general and perhaps fundamental property of nature. Mind would then exist, in some form, in all things. Broadly speaking, this is the view known as panpsychism.</p>
<p>To put a bit more structure to our definition, we may say that panpsychism holds that all things have a mind or a mind-like quality. It is an ancient concept, dating back to the earliest days of both Eastern and Western civilizations. In fact, until the past hundred years or so, panpsychism was a respected and widely held viewpoint. In many cases it was regarded as obvious and in no need of defense. But with the rise of analytic, linguistic, and anti-metaphysical philosophy in the early twentieth century, panpsychism was pushed to the sidelines of intellectual discourse. Even today, it is spoken of in dismissive tones by many orthodox philosophers. In the past few decades, though, it has witnessed something of a renaissance, both in and outside conventional analytic circles. The time is right, then, to conduct a detailed investigation of the phenomenon of panpsychism within Western philosophy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If we take panpsychism to be the view that all things possess mind, this raises at least two immediate questions, one concerning the nature of &#x201C;things&#x201D; and the other concerning the nature of &#x201C;mind.&#x201D; Generally speaking, panpsychist philosophers attempt to make some progress on both central issues; that is, they attempt to elaborate on precisely which entities in the universe qualify as mind-possessing, and they attempt to describe in some detail the mental qualities of such objects. I should note here that panpsychism doesn&#x2019;t entail that every conceivable entity possesses mind. For example, valid panpsychist theories may exclude composite or collective entities, such as piles of sand, or tables and chairs. They may exclude physical ultimates such as atoms&#x2014;or they may include <i>only</i> physical ultimates. They may include matter but exclude various forms of energy. They may exclude conceptual or logical entities, such as numbers. I will therefore interpret panpsychism in a soft sense: that mind is very widespread, is nearly universal in extent, and crosses deeply into the inorganic realm. The precise extent of mind depends on the particular theory at hand.</p>
<p>The nature of things and the nature of mind are, of course, central to many aspects of philosophy. Panpsychism, however, lies at a unique intersection of the two concepts, in that mind is seen as fundamental, in some sense, to the nature of existence and being. If all things (appropriately defined) have mind, then any theory of mind is necessarily a theory about ontology, about the nature of extant things. This is unlike most other notions of mind, virtually all of which either make no statement on which objects possess it, or make implicit or explicit assumptions about its confinement to humans or, occasionally, the higher animals. Panpsychism alone is at once a conception of mind and a conception of reality.</p>
<p>And there are further distinctions. First, panpsychism is a unique kind of theory of mind. Its central feature is not that it examines or describes mind <i>per se</i>&#x2014;although many panpsychists do this&#x2014;but rather that it argues for a widespread or universal extent. In this sense it is a higher-order theory, a meta-theory, of mind. It is a theory about theories. It simply holds that, however one conceives of mind, such mind applies to all things. Because of this, there are panpsychist extensions of most conventional theories. For example, one could be a <i>panpsychist dualist</i>, holding that some Supreme Being has granted a soul or a mind to all things. Or one could be a <i>panpsychist functionalist</i>, interpreting the functional role of every object as mind, even if such a role is only to gravitate or to resist pressure. Or one could argue for a <i>panpsychist identism</i> in which mind is identical to matter, or a <i>panpsychist reductive materialism</i> in which the mind of each thing is reducible to its physical states. In fact panpsychism could apply, in principle, to almost any current theory of mind by explicitly extending its range of applicability. The only theories not applicable would be those that expressly target a specific physiology, such as biological organisms, neural structures, Homo sapiens, etc., or those that deny mind altogether, such as eliminativism. Such theories, though, are rare and, for many, unconvincing.</p>
<p>In fact, as we will see, it is arguably more logical and more natural to assume broad or even universal applicability of mind, unless one is able to convincingly argue to the contrary. In other words, it is plausible that panpsychism should be the default stance of any theory of mind, and only abandoned if it can be shown to be false. A related sentiment was put forth by Galen Strawson, who argues for &#x201C;the theoretical primacy of panpsychism&#x201D; (2015a: 203). This thesis, he says, &#x201C;obliges us to favour some version of panpsychism &#x2026; over all other positive substantive theories.&#x201D; The strongest version of this thesis is not merely that &#x201C;it would take extraordinarily hard work to justify preferring any substantive metaphysical position that isn&#x2019;t panpsychist&#x201D;; rather, &#x201C;that it can&#x2019;t be done.&#x201D; I will elaborate on Strawson&#x2019;s views later on. For the moment, suffice to say that panpsychism has widespread theoretical applicability, and arguments to the contrary are surprisingly difficult to articulate.</p>
<p>In order to qualify as a complete theory, a panpsychist outlook must be complemented by a positive theory of mind that explicitly describes how mind is to be conceived and how it is connected or related to physical objects. Some philosophers have stopped short of this by simply expressing an intuition or belief that mind is universal in extent, and leaving it at that. This approach clearly and justifiably opens one up to philosophical criticism. Not that intuitions are unimportant; they do matter, and can often point to fruitful lines of inquiry. But to rely primarily on them is to open the way for a broad attack on panpsychism generally as not sufficiently grounded or analytic.</p>
<p>Another distinction for panpsychism is the unique role that it has played in the history of philosophy. As I mentioned, it is almost certainly the most ancient conception of the psyche. In the forms of animism and polytheism, it was probably the dominant view for most or all of the pre-historical era. Eastern cultures have a nearly continuous record of panpsychist metaphysics, right through the modern era.<a id="FN2a"/><a href="#FN2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was also widely accepted, though not often explicitly argued for, in the early years of Western thought. With the emergence of Christian theology, panpsychism fell into decline for a number of centuries, but it made a comeback with the naturalist philosophers of the sixteenth century. Support grew steadily in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, reaching a zenith in the late 1800s and the early 1900s. With the advent of logical positivism and conventional materialism or physicalism,<a id="FN3a"/><a href="#FN3"><sup>3</sup></a> panpsychism was once again driven down, along with most metaphysical theories, to a relatively low standing. In the past few years there has been a resurgence of sorts, and it has once more become a topic of serious philosophical inquiry. Panpsychism poses a unique challenge to the dominant physicalist view of today, and thus assumes a role of special importance.</p>
<p>Hence, both an investigation of panpsychism&#x2019;s historical background and a comparative study of the field are highly significant for present-day philosophical discussion. The main reasons, in sum, are the following.</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle"><b>Panpsychism occupies a unique and valuable position in philosophy.</b>&#x2003;As has been mentioned, it is at once an ontology and a meta-theory of mind. It intimately links being and mind in a way no other system does. It tells us something important about mind, and something important about reality itself.</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle"><b>Panpsychism offers resolutions to mind-body problems that dualism and materialism find intractable.</b>&#x2003;Present-day philosophy of mind is dominated by materialist theories that cannot adequately address issues of consciousness, qualia, or the emergence of mind in the universe. Dualism is the traditional alternative, but it too suffers from long-standing weaknesses and unanswered questions. Panpsychism offers a third way that avoids or resolves certain difficulties while providing inherent advantages.</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle"><b>Panpsychism has important ethical consequences.</b>&#x2003;It argues that the human mind is not an anomaly in the universe, but that the human and the non-human alike share the quality of enmindedness. By virtue of this common and universal characteristic, we may come to know the universe more intimately and perhaps find ourselves at home in it. This in turn can serve as a basis for more compassionate and ecological values, and therefore of new ways of acting in the world.<a id="FN4a"/><a href="#FN4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="paraaftertitle"><b>Panpsychism brings into sharp relief the nature of conventional &#x201C;mechanistic&#x201D; physicalism.</b>&#x2003;Present-day philosophical thinking, and even present-day social and political systems, are largely rooted in a mechanistic view of the cosmos that was inherited from Hobbes, Descartes, and Newton: the view of the universe as a place of dead, insensate matter driven by mechanical forces. In such a universe, mind is an unexplained and perhaps unexplainable mystery, a &#x201C;great exception&#x201D; in the cosmic scheme. Throughout history, panpsychism has served, at almost every point, as an antipode to this mechanistic theory of mind and reality. Panpsychism stands in stark contrast to the long-dominant worldview.</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle"><b>Panpsychism is perhaps the most underanalyzed philosophical position in Western philosophy, and is long overdue for a detailed treatment.</b>&#x2003;The present volume is the first formal, systematic survey of the field. A few other works have made partial attempts, but they have either been too restrictive in scope or have addressed the topic from a narrow philosophical perspective.<a id="FN5a"/><a href="#FN5"><sup>5</sup></a> This is a grievous oversight insofar as there have been nearly three dozen major philosophers in the past five centuries, and far more lesser figures, who have articulated versions of panpsychism. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that panpsychism is utterly unknown to a large majority of present-day philosophers.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The remainder of this chapter will explore some general issues surrounding philosophy of mind and how they relate to the relevant ontological and psychological concepts. Subsequent chapters will address the specific writings of various thinkers in detail, documenting their panpsychist views and indicating something of their rationale. The final chapter will summarize the arguments for panpsychism, compare these with recent opposing arguments, and then attempt to place the panpsychist movement in a larger perspective.</p></section>

<h2><a id="S2"/>1.2&#x2003;<a id="d2e217"/>Panpsychism Defined</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Philosophical arguments often turn on interpretations of definitions. This is particularly so with issues of mind and consciousness&#x2014;and perhaps even more so with panpsychism. Though the concept is ancient, the term itself was coined by Italian philosopher Francesco Patrizi in the late sixteenth century. It derives from the Greek <i>pan</i> (&#x201C;all&#x201D;) and <i>psyche</i> (&#x201C;soul&#x201D; or &#x201C;mind&#x201D;). The association of <i>psyche</i> with &#x201C;soul&#x201D; is problematic for many contemporary secular and naturalist philosophers, and thus I will, for the most part, leave that issue aside. Here I will take <i>psyche</i> to mean &#x201C;mind,&#x201D; as commonly&#x2014;if vaguely&#x2014;understood.</p>
<p>If we can agree that &#x2018;panpsychism&#x2019; broadly means &#x201C;all has mind,&#x201D; further articulation becomes difficult. Once we begin to categorize &#x201C;all,&#x201D; and to break down the concept of mind, numerous issues arise and opinions diverge. Analysis of mind inevitably addresses such matters as consciousness, sentience, cognition, belief, qualia, and so on&#x2014;all of which are ambiguous and contentious. The issues are serious enough when we are (implicitly) restricting our discussion to human minds, but these terms become very problematic as we move down the phylogenic chain. When we attempt to universalize them, the problems can become enormous.</p>
<p>In the attempt to minimize these concerns, it will be constructive to examine some of the associated terms. First, though, I will review various definitions of panpsychism in the literature. Timothy Sprigge, in the entry on panpsychism in the <i>Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>, offers this definition:</p><blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Physical nature is composed of individuals, each of which is to some degree sentient. &#x2026; [They may be said to have] sentience, experience, or, in a broad sense, consciousness. (Sprigge 1998a: 195)</p></blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">However, one rarely finds the same definition twice. Here are some others:</p><blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">All objects in the universe &#x2026; have an &#x201C;inner&#x201D; or &#x201C;psychological&#x201D; being. (Edwards 1967: 22)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Everything has a soul, or &#x2026; a rudiment of a soul. (Popper and Eccles 1977: 15)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe. (Seager 2001)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Panpsychism is the view that mentality is present in all natural bodies with unified and persisting organization. (Clarke 2003: 1)</p></blockquote>
<p class="paraaftertitle">We even find variability within the same source. Chalmers (1996), for example, defines it once as &#x201C;everything is conscious&#x201D; (216) and elsewhere as &#x201C;everything has a mind&#x201D; (298), apparently regarding the two as equivalent. More recently, he has refined and restricted his definition: &#x201C;I will understand panpsychism as the thesis that some fundamental physical entities are conscious.&#x201D; (2015: 246) The divergence here from the other views is striking. Despite this considerable variability, we may agree that the general meaning is understood, and may be captured&#x2014;at the highest level&#x2014;as the notion that all things have a mind, or a mind-like quality.</p>
<p>As soon as we allow the possibility that all things may possess mind, we are anxious to elaborate. What, precisely, do we mean by such a claim? Which specific mental qualities apply to non-human animals, or plants, or rocks, or atoms? There are many terms in the philosophical literature that relate to noetic qualities and abilities, and a brief survey will unearth the following (among many others): consciousness, self-consciousness, thought, cognition, intelligence, feelings, experience, inner life, what-it-is-like (to be something), qualitative feel, qualia, will, phenomenal feel, awareness, belief, perception, sense, sentience, and subjectivity. All these terms obviously evolved in a human context, and the meanings of all are rooted in our collective human experiences. This makes any textual definition or philosophical usage problematic, when it comes to subject at hand.</p>
<p>With respect to a definition of panpsychism, certain terms seem particularly troublesome. Let me highlight three of them: &#x2018;consciousness&#x2019;, &#x2018;soul&#x2019;, and &#x2018;thought&#x2019;. &#x2018;Consciousness&#x2019; is highly anthropocentric, and its meaning is very closely associated with specifically human mental states. The term derives from the Latin <i>com</i> (with) + <i>scire</i> (know), meaning &#x201C;to know something with oneself&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, self-knowledge or self-awareness. For most of us, &#x2018;consciousness&#x2019; refers to the aware and alert mental states that human beings normally experience in their waking hours. This meaning is firmly entrenched, even for philosophers. Thus, to attempt to expand its applicability to all things is, arguably, to fight an unnecessary uphill battle. This is not to suggest we should abandon it, even in a panpsychist context. The term is certainly useful for primates and so-called higher animals, and probably the &#x201C;lower&#x201D; ones as well. It gets more difficult when speaking of plants, or collective entities such as forests, coral reefs, or the Earth as a whole. Very few would allow the term for inanimate objects, and any attempt to do so likely poses insurmountable conceptual barriers.<a id="FN6a"/><a href="#FN6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In general, panpsychists are highly sensitive to the use of the word &#x2018;consciousness&#x2019;, and for good reason. Upon laying out a panpsychist position, one is immediately faced with the charge that he believes that &#x201C;rocks are conscious&#x201D;&#x2014;a statement taken as so obviously ludicrous that panpsychism can be safely dismissed out of hand. Such a tactic is clearly a logical fallacy, but it has some rhetorical force. To maintain consciousness as a universal quality demands an intricate and detailed defense, one that is arguably doomed to failure. Comparisons to human consciousness are inevitable and yet potentially irrelevant. And this is apart from the fact that human consciousness is very problematic in itself&#x2014;notably, its definition, its qualitative nature, and its physical correlates. This makes it a poor candidate for universal ascription.</p>
<p>Different issues arise with the notion of the soul. As has been mentioned, my focus here is on naturalistic panpsychism, and thus I will generally set aside any supernatural or theological variations. The exceptions will be with those philosophers who themselves utilize the term, either explicitly or via common translation. The Greek word <i>psyche</i> is, of course, typically translated as &#x2018;soul&#x2019;, and thus we find extensive reference in the pre-Socratics, in Plato, and in Aristotle. Soul is also a point of discussion for the Italian naturalists, for Leibniz, and even for the French vitalistic materialists. The last major panpsychist philosopher to discuss the soul was Gustav Fechner, in the mid 1800s; since that time, there has been almost no such talk in serious philosophical discourse. We find occasional reference to the somewhat preferable term &#x2018;spirit&#x2019;, but even this carries an air of superstition and mystery, and thus is best avoided. Talk of the soul is best left to the theologians, or to those philosophers who prefer to speak poetically or metaphorically.</p>
<p>The larger message here is that present-day philosophers should not avoid use of, or reference to, panpsychism for fear of invoking unacceptable religious or theological concepts. With perhaps one or two minor exceptions, panpsychism has not involved the soul for more than 200 years. No present-day panpsychist interprets <i>psyche</i> as &#x201C;soul.&#x201D; Panpsychism is not a spiritual or theological theory. It is as naturalistic, rationalistic, and hard-nosed as any current theory of mind.</p>
<p>The third term, &#x2018;thought&#x2019;, typically involves purposeful planning, considering of alternatives, basic logical calculation, and perhaps even holding of beliefs. Most would attribute these qualities only to animals, in various degrees. A related concept, cognition, refers to an especially deep and insightful thinking, a reasoning power through the use of inference or deduction&#x2014;primarily the rational thought process of humans. Thinking thus seems to be an authentic feature of the so-called higher animals, is therefore best restricted to them. There is perhaps a very loose sense in which &#x201C;to think&#x201D; could mean to process information, and this would naturally involve a much wider scope, arguably universal. But there seems to be little benefit in doing so. Information processing is a generally distinct property from thinking, on most accounts, and is best treated as such. Therefore thinking, along with consciousness and soul, are probably best avoided when speaking of properties of universal mind.</p>
<p>The central point here is that discussions of the meaning of panpsychism should avoid the most heavily anthropocentric terms, which cloud the discussion more often than they provide clarity. And the use of such loaded terms is in any event unnecessary, as is demonstrated in the working definition above. Certain terms seem to be the most general and least restrictive; these might include <i>mind</i>, <i>mentality</i>, <i>experience</i>, and even <i>qualia</i>. There are good arguments for certain intentional qualities, such as <i>will</i> and <i>belief</i>, to serve as universal properties. Even <i>psyche</i>, left untranslated and suitably defined, may serve as a universal noetic quality. Hence, these concepts are perhaps more appropriately used in connection with panpsychist descriptions of reality.</p>
<p>Some philosophers have recognized these definitional problems and made efforts to alleviate the situation. One tactic is to use a qualifier, such as &#x2018;proto&#x2019; with &#x2018;mentality&#x2019;, &#x2018;low grade&#x2019; with &#x2018;awareness&#x2019;, or &#x2018;occasions of&#x2019; with &#x2018;experience&#x2019;. But this approach has at least two weaknesses. First, if the base term is anthropocentric, then it is hard to see the advantage of softening it through some qualifier. Proto-consciousness, for example, is still inevitably seen as something comparable to human consciousness, and thus doesn&#x2019;t avoid the underlying anthropocentrism. Second, philosophers who use such qualifiers seem to want to have their metaphysical cake and eat it too. Proto-mind, they claim, is something more than pure insentience, but something less than true mind. But this is arguably incoherent. Does proto-mind have a foot in each camp? Or is it some new, third category? Does it share qualities of each side? If so, how does this work? Ultimately, either proto-mind is mental, or it is not. Whichever way it falls, it seems to exclude the other possibility. Therefore it doesn&#x2019;t serve its claimed purpose as a kind of bridging concept or middle ground.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It may be useful at this point to propose a sort of panpsychist hierarchy of terminology, ranging from the most human-like to the most universal. This is by no means the commonly accepted order, and certainly every philosopher would construct a different arrangement,<a id="FN7a"/><a href="#FN7"><sup>7</sup></a> but it may serve as a framework for furthering the general discussion of panpsychism.</p>
<p>Humans clearly admit to all standard mental attributes, and I will assume for present purposes that the same apply to all primates; efforts to find uniquely human mental qualities, vis-&#x00E0;-vis our primate cousins, have yet to succeed. They seem to possess counterparts of all our mental aspects. If we consider the animal kingdom as a whole, we find a vast range of creatures, from the more complex mammals to such simple organisms as sponges, hydras, and flatworms. I reject an ontological distinction between higher and lower animals as meaningless and arbitrary, but I do acknowledge a presumed wide range of mental qualities, commensurate with physiological complexity. Looking at the other kingdoms of living organisms, we see gray areas between them, and we find difficulty comparing the more complex organisms of one kingdom with the less complex organisms of another. It isn&#x2019;t clear, for example, that a complex plant such as an orchid is less sentient or aware than a sponge or a flatworm, or that a mushroom&#x2014;a multicellular member of the fungi kingdom&#x2014;is less mental than a one-celled diatom. Even the border between living and non-living is vague, in view of the status of things like viruses and prions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it may be useful to attempt to assign various terms to different high-level phylogenic categories. I make one such proposal in <a id="T1.1a"/><a href="#T1.1">table 1.1</a>. The terms in the first grouping&#x2014;&#x2018;mind&#x2019;, &#x2018;mentality&#x2019;, &#x2018;experience&#x2019;, &#x2018;belief&#x2019;, &#x2018;what-it&#x2019;s-like&#x2019;, &#x2018;qualia&#x2019;, &#x2018;nous&#x2019;, &#x2018;psyche&#x2019;, &#x2018;will&#x2019;&#x2014;are, I suggest, most suitable for a panpsychist application. All these terms recur in the various historical positions, as we will see.</p>

<p>Definitions of panpsychism are one source of confusion; synonyms are another. The philosophical literature contains a number of terms that are related to panpsychism, and are often inappropriately identified with it. Such terms bear a brief discussion. In no particular order, they are animism, hylozoism, pansensism, panbiotism, vitalism, pantheism, panentheism, and panexperientialism.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Animism&#x2019; derives from the Latin <i>anima</i> (&#x201C;soul&#x201D;), and is the belief that everything in the world has a soul or a spirit. Typically connected to pre-Christian or tribal religions and indigenous cultures, animism has a strong air of superstition and mystery. It is most commonly used in a primitive, pre-scientific sense in which objects have identifiable and characteristic spirits&#x2014;e.g., &#x201C;the spirit of the tree&#x201D; inhabiting an oak or &#x201C;the water-spirit&#x201D; inhabiting a lake. These spirits typically have a human-like personality or other qualities that exhibit the properties of a rational person, perhaps including intelligence, belief, memory, emotion, and agency. Furthermore, such spirits are typically not bound to the physical realm; they are, in some vague sense, immaterial and supernatural beings. This dualistic, spiritual, and highly anthropocentric nature characterizes animism and distinguishes it from philosophical panpsychism, which generally doesn&#x2019;t attribute high-level capabilities to non-human entities. Animism is thus taken as having little if any philosophical standing.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Hylozoism&#x2019; derives from the Greek <i>hyle</i> (&#x201C;matter&#x201D;) and <i>zoe</i> (&#x201C;life&#x201D;); it is the doctrine that all matter is intrinsically alive. The term was coined in 1678 by the Platonist Ralph Cudworth in his influential work <i>True Intellectual System of the Universe</i>. It has traditionally been used in reference to the early Greek philosophers, given that they spoke the most explicitly about life in all things. Their language thus provides the term something of a philosophical pedigree. But the concept is not restricted to the ancient Greeks. Even into the late 1800s, the philosophers Ernst Haeckel and Friedrich Paulsen openly described themselves as hylozoists; Paulsen called hylozoism &#x201C;a conception which almost irresistibly forces itself upon modern biology&#x201D; (1892/1895: 100). This view continued into the early twentieth century, as certain prominent scientist-philosophers&#x2014;including Wilfred Agar and John Haldane&#x2014;argued for a hylozoist worldview. Things began to change by the middle of the twentieth century, though, as scientists developed more precise notions of life. In 1944, Kasten Tallmadge asserted that &#x201C;to call a contemporary scientist hylozoist would be simply to utter an anachronism&#x201D; (187). And yet there continue to be exceptions. As late as 1982, the physicist David Bohm posited that &#x201C;in a way, nature is alive &#x2026; all the way to the depths&#x201D; (39).<a id="FN8a"/><a href="#FN8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Of all the synonyms for panpsychism, hylozoism is perhaps most commonly and closely associated with it. But panpsychism is now the preferred term, largely because we have a better understanding of what constitutes life. Except for such borderline cases as viruses, we generally understand what it means to be alive, and it is clear that tables, rocks, stars, and atoms are not formally living things.<a id="FN9a"/><a href="#FN9"><sup>9</sup></a> As with the various concepts of mentality, the notion of life can become an unnecessary point of disagreement and confusion. It is perhaps best to take it in the ordinary scientific sense and apply it only to living organisms as conventionally understood. As such, there is little place for hylozoism in the present-day philosophical discourse.</p>
<p>Panbiotism is essentially identical to hylozoism. It was apparently introduced by the philosopher Paul Carus, editor of the journal <i>The Monist</i>, in 1892. He defined panbiotism as the view that &#x201C;everything is fraught with life; it contains life; it has the ability to live.&#x201D; Following the ancient Greek usage, he defined life as exhibiting &#x201C;spontaneity or self-motion.&#x201D; Why he did not use &#x2018;hylozoism&#x2019; is unclear. Regardless, panbiotism is now rarely used, as is the case with the related term &#x2018;panzoism&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Vitalism gained prominence in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as an attempt to explain the mysterious nature of living organisms. Emerging sciences of chemistry and physics seemed to account for much of the universe, but the phenomenon of life resisted easy explanation&#x2014;as, in many ways, it does today. Scientists and philosophers thus speculated that an extra substance or principle of some sort, something non-physical, was present in living organisms. This vital force or <i>&#x00E9;lan vital</i> was widely sought, but never found. Notably, nothing about vitalism ever suggested panpsychism; it was a nominal account of the nature of living things, not all things. Be that as it may, we do find a link to panpsychism in the work of Henri Bergson, who was an explicit vitalist and borderline panpsychist. But this aspect of his thinking failed to win adherents. By the 1930s, vitalism had largely been discredited, and it is now considered mere pseudoscience. Critics of panpsychism occasionally deride the view as vitalistic, but this is a meaningless logical fallacy. In any case, vitalism is no longer a part of serious philosophical discourse, and has no bearing on the question of panpsychism.</p>
<p>Pansensism&#x2014;&#x201C;everything senses&#x201D;&#x2014;is typically associated with the panpsychist views of Bernardino Telesio, Tommaso Campanella, and Ernst Mach. It is synonymous with the rarely used &#x2018;hylopathism&#x2019;. Pansensism, like panpsychism, deserves to be more widely discussed. The word &#x2018;sense&#x2019; derives from the Latin <i>sentire</i>, &#x201C;to feel&#x201D;; this suggests that sensation is not merely a mechanism of perception, but involves a qualitative aspect as well. In common usage, sensation frequently takes on an anthropocentric meaning, in that it is associated with our five sense organs and the corresponding mental perceptions. In its broader meaning, however&#x2014;that of a mechanism of perception&#x2014;it becomes an awareness of, and reaction to, external stimuli. This meaning is much more amenable to a panpsychist interpretation. It is clear that all things react to, and thus in a way perceive, their environment; the questions then are &#x201C;Is there a corresponding mental state of any kind?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Is there an actual feeling, a qualitative state, a quale?&#x201D; These questions must be answered in the affirmative if true pansensism is to be defended.</p>
<p>Pantheism is the view that all (<i>pan</i>) is God (<i>theos</i>)&#x2014;that God is identical with everything that exists, i.e., the universe. What precisely this means is not entirely clear, but it seems to suggest, at a minimum, that all material objects&#x2014;including humans&#x2014;are part of that divinity, and that the divine is a unity. It also typically implies that God is a non-personal being, that there is no creator or intentional providence in the world, and that there is no transcendent or supernatural realm.</p>
<p>The Greeks were the first pantheists. Plato writes: &#x201C;this world, which [the Creator] begat for himself, is a blessed god&#x201D; (<i>Timaeus</i> 34b9). Later, rejecting the possibility of multiple universes, he remarks that &#x201C;there [is] but one world, a god&#x201D; (55d6). The Stoics then followed his lead. According to Diogenes Laertius, &#x201C;Zeno says that the entire cosmos and the heaven are the substance of god, and so does Chrysippus&#x201D; (<i>Lives of the Philosophers</i>, 7.147). Centuries later, Spinoza resurrected the idea when he equated God with Nature. A point of interest: Even though there is no logical connection between pantheism and panpsychism, it remains true that many major pantheists in history were also panpsychists&#x2014;including those mentioned above.</p>
<p>Panentheism is related to pantheism and is often confused with it. The etymological meaning is <i>pan-en-theos</i>: &#x201C;all in God,&#x201D; or, more simply, &#x201C;God is in all things.&#x201D; The term seems to have originated in the writings of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause around 1828. An analogy can be made to a sponge: Just as water can saturate a sponge without being the sponge, so too God is said to saturate all things while remaining transcendent and unchanging. On an alternate reading of the term, God is the soul of the cosmos, a world-soul, and the physical universe is his body. This view isn&#x2019;t far from the standard Christian interpretation of the omnipresence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Thus understood, we can see the possibility for confusion with panpsychism. On the traditional view, God is omnipresent. If God represents spirit or mind, then all things can be said to contain mind&#x2014;the mind of God. The central issue here is whether there is ultimately only one mind in the universe (God, the Absolute, the World Soul, etc.), or if the cosmic mind differentiates itself into individual enminded entities. The former is a highly monist conception of panentheism, and would seem to disallow the existence of even individual human minds. The latter view is difficult to articulate clearly, but might conceivably point to a kind of pluralistic panpsychism.</p>
<p>Finally, we have panexperientialism, the doctrine that &#x201C;everything experiences.&#x201D; The term was coined by the process philosopher David Ray Griffin (1977: 98) to define a particular version of panpsychism deriving from Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. Whitehead took events, or &#x201C;occasions,&#x201D; to be the fundamental metaphysical reality, and this was linked to the concept of experience&#x2014;a move undoubtedly influenced by William James&#x2019; theory of &#x201C;pure experience&#x201D; as the basis of all reality. Thanks to the persistence and diligence of the process philosophers, panexperientialism is at present a well-developed form of panpsychism. Hartshorne, Griffin, Christian de Quincey, David Clarke, and other process philosophers may be credited with keeping alive the debate over panpsychism in general, and they have marshaled a large amount of evidence, both to support their position and to criticize the dominant materialist and dualist ontologies. For an early account, see Hartshorne 1937; for more recent articulations, see Hartshorne 1977, Griffin 1998, de Quincey 2002, and Clarke 2003.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">On the question of definitions, synonyms, and possible confusions, a final brief word should be said about the connection to idealism. Metaphysical idealism is the view that mind, or something mind-like, is the fundamental reality of the world. As such, it bears a superficial resemblance to panpsychism. But this is misleading. Panpsychism, we recall, is the view that all things possess minds or have intrinsic mental attributes. This doesn&#x2019;t entail that all things <i>are</i> mind(s). One can be an idealist without being a panpsychist, taking Berkeley, Kant, and Hegel as cases in point. And clearly one can be a panpsychist without being an idealist. In fact, most panpsychists in history were not idealists in the metaphysical sense. Certainly there were idealist philosophers who were also panpsychists&#x2014;Schopenhauer, Josiah Royce, Francis Bradley, and Tim Sprigge come to mind&#x2014;but their idealism was supplemental to, not entailed by, their panpsychism. Thus, any attempted identification of panpsychism with idealism is inappropriate and unjustified.</p></section>

<h2><a id="S3"/>1.3&#x2003;<a id="d2e656"/>The Question of Emergence</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One of the strongest arguments for panpsychism today springs from the intrinsic weakness of its main competitor: emergentism. This requires some elaboration.</p>
<p>Even though they may not acknowledge it, nearly every contemporary philosopher of mind is an emergentist. They believe that, in the distant past, mind did not exist. Today, it does. Ergo, it must have emerged, in an absolute sense, from an organic milieu that was devoid of mind. Yes, they say, this must have happened; admittedly, they are not sure when or how, but self-evidently, it must have occurred. In any case, no further need for philosophers to ponder the matter. This is a question for paleontology or physiology, not philosophy. No important philosophical issues attach to it&#x2014;or so they believe.</p>
<p>Panpsychists reply &#x201C;Not so fast.&#x201D; When spelled out, the emergentist position is found to be rife with problems, questions, and profound implications.</p>
<p>Let me recount the emergentist position a bit more carefully. They believe, explicitly or implicitly, that there was a point in the past history of the Earth&#x2014;say, a few hundred million years ago&#x2014;when there were no mind-bearing organisms in existence. Before Homo sapiens, before mammalian life, before any &#x201C;higher animals&#x201D; at all, there were no experiencing beings on the planet. Biology ran strictly on unthinking, unperceiving, unfeeling instinct. There was no sadness, no happiness, no pain, no joy&#x2014;anywhere at all on Earth. Hunger merely triggered a biological reflex to seek out food. A quenched thirst felt like nothing&#x2014;rather, it was like the fuel gauge on a car: One drank, the needle &#x201C;rose,&#x201D; the body was sated. When fleeing a predator, there was nothing at all like a sensation of fear; organisms simply ran, hid, or fought back. Sexual intercourse was in no sense enjoyable, but strictly a physical act that perpetuated the species.</p>
<p>Then, at some crucial point in organic evolution, the first enminded creature appeared. That is, <i>suddenly</i> appeared. Some first select species&#x2014;and indeed, some first individual organism&#x2014;suddenly &#x201C;felt&#x201D; the world. Suddenly, the light bulb went on. Suddenly, for the first time in the known universe, an entity actually experienced reality. Pleasures and pains actually felt a certain way. Fear, happiness, anger, jealously &#x2026; these actually now meant something. For the first time ever, it was something to be like a living organism.<a id="FN10a"/><a href="#FN10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>How, panpsychists ask, did this miracle happen? How could two parental organisms&#x2014;which were not &#x201C;slightly&#x201D; or &#x201C;proto&#x201D; enminded but completely and utterly devoid of mind&#x2014;give birth to an offspring that, for the first time ever, experienced the world? Was it a genetic fluke? A birth defect? A naturalistic miracle? And not just once&#x2014;the same miraculous event must then have occurred over and over again, countless times, to many different sets of unminded parents. And then, later, to many other species&#x2014;if we accept that enmindedness extends beyond our own. The end result is that, today, we and an indeterminate number of other species actually experience pain and pleasure, actually feel things, and thus are true ontological subjects.</p>
<p>The miraculous nature of such an event is hard to overestimate. Mind came from that which was utterly devoid of mind. Enminded children came from utterly unminded parents. Mentality, subjectivity, qualia, suddenly appeared, like a bolt from the blue, having never existed in the known universe. This is brute emergence. Panpsychists call brute emergence a miracle, and claim that miracles don&#x2019;t exist. Mind could never have emerged from no-mind. Therefore, it was there all along. And if it was there all along, panpsychism obtains.</p>
<p>Now, it is clear that this is not to say that <i>nothing</i> emerges. Emergence happens all the time, and it always has. In fact, nearly everything that we see around us emerged. Every structured being in the universe&#x2014;animals, plants, rocks, planets, stars&#x2014;all, at some point, did not exist; now they do; therefore they did indeed emerge.</p>
<p>But not everything can plausibly do so. Time, for instance, seems inconceivable to have ever emerged from a timeless cosmos. So too with space; we simply cannot conceive how spatiality could have come into being in a universe that was non-spatial. Time and space must have always existed, everywhere. They are &#x201C;pan&#x201D; qualities of reality. Other entities likely fall into this non-emergent category. Mass/energy may be one. And certain sub-atomic qualities, like spin, charge, and quantum state, may be the same.</p>
<p>Panpsychists add one more item to the list: mind. Experientiality, subjectivity, qualia &#x2026; the emergence of such things is inconceivable, from a universe utterly without them. If they did, it is a true miracle. And if we allow miracles, then anything is possible. Panpsychists prefer a rational, naturalistic, and non-miraculous universe. And in such a universe, mind must have always been present.</p>
<p>In addition to this historical emergence problem, there are two other forms. One is what we may call the phylogenic question: Among the organisms living today, which ones possess mind? Nearly everyone grants awareness and experience to the so-called higher animals, at least. And yet no one feels competent to define these fortunate creatures. Primates, dolphins, and whales? Surely. Dogs and cats? Probably. But mice? Goldfish? Earthworms? Fruit flies? Jellyfish? Amoeba? Sponges? We can see the problem. Again, conventional philosophers can declare this a non-issue, or simply relegate it to those exploring the fringe topic of &#x201C;animal minds.&#x201D; But from a perspective of understanding the ontology of mind, we need to know: Where can we draw the line? And how can justify drawing it there? And if we can&#x2019;t justify it, perhaps the line doesn&#x2019;t exist. Perhaps all life, at least, is experiential.<a id="FN11a"/><a href="#FN11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>A third form of the emergence problem is ontogenic. Consider a developing human fetus. When, in the span of those nine months, does the fetus suddenly acquire a mind? For the emergentist, a fertilized egg is utterly mindless, whereas a newborn infant is (presumably) fully experiential. So the emergentist must ask, At what point in the process does the light suddenly switch on? But any answer he gives will be deficient. No single moment in time, no specific number of cells, is necessary and sufficient to switch on consciousness or sentience. The emergentist has no plausible and defensible answer. The panpsychist thus has the stronger case: No sudden switch happens. There is no one magic cell, or one special moment, that turns on the light. The fetus is enminded and experiencing from Day 1&#x2014;even if at an extremely low level.<a id="FN12a"/><a href="#FN12"><sup>12</sup></a> For that matter, so are the unfertilized egg and every individual sperm cell.</p>
<p>The bottom line seems quite clear: One is either an emergentist, or one is a panpsychist. There seems to be no middle ground.<a id="FN13a"/><a href="#FN13"><sup>13</sup></a> Either the early Earth&#x2014;and the early universe&#x2014;was mindless, or it was not. If we claim that it was originally mindless, we have an obligation to explain the miraculous, brute emergence of the experiencing subject. If we cannot explain it, the panpsychist case becomes all the stronger.</p>
<p>Now, all this is not to say that panpsychists don&#x2019;t have their own version of an emergence problem. If, say, our individual cells are experiential, how do their lesser minds relate to our one, unified, higher-order mind? Do they compose it? If so, how does this work?<a id="FN14a"/><a href="#FN14"><sup>14</sup></a> Do they exist in parallel? Do we then in fact have many minds in our bodies? If so, why don&#x2019;t we sense this? And in any case, where does our higher-level mind come from? These are important problems that the panpsychist must address. But, I emphasize, these are lesser-order problems than that posed by brute emergence. It is intrinsically more difficult to explain the absolute appearance of some quality, than to explain how it complexifies. If one must have problems, one generally prefers that they are at least tractable. The complexifying, combinatorial nature of mind is a riddle, but we have analytic methods to address it. Brute emergence of mind is a miracle, and little more can be said.</p></section>

<h2><a id="S4"/>1.4&#x2003;<a id="d2e732"/>Historical Approaches</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The following chapters lay out the case for the role of panpsychism in the history of Western philosophy. It is no exaggeration to state that very few philosophers today, even philosophers of mind, understand much at all of this lengthy and significant history. Most will know the concept of panpsychism, but when pressed to identify some prominent advocates, they will struggle to list more than half a dozen names. Furthermore, most find panpsychism vaguely embarrassing, and thus will rarely acknowledge its presence in their favored philosophers. Not uncommonly, many will explicitly deny that a certain individual was a panpsychist, despite clear textual evidence to the contrary. Often the topic is simply avoided, as being too troublesome or inconvenient.</p>
<p>My first task, therefore, is to establish and document the panpsychist views of the various philosophers. In nearly every case I draw from primary sources, though the use of secondary references will be necessary in some instances. The cases for many individuals are clear and explicit, but others are somewhat vague and open to interpretation. For each thinker I will marshal the strongest possible case for panpsychism, while considering counter-arguments as required.</p>
<p>Three issues stand out, when viewing the large historical sweep presented here. First, and surprisingly, many philosophers seem to almost take panpsychism for granted. They often view it as unexceptional, as something like a conventional stance, and as needing little defense. Some make brief passing comments supportive of panpsychism, and leave it at that. From a present-day skeptical standpoint, this is unsatisfactory; we are often left wanting to hear more of the arguments, the defense, and the implications. But we are frequently disappointed. Nonetheless, the views stated will typically suffice to establish the individual thinker as a panpsychist.</p>
<p>Second, there are varying degrees of commitment to the concept. This is due to the broad range of panpsychist theories of mind, and also to the scope of mental aspects under consideration. Some philosophers seem merely sympathetic, and stop short of endorsement. Others find the view compelling but also have significant concerns, such that, in the balance of pro and con, one doesn&#x2019;t know their final stance on the issue. In yet other cases we must rely on other, third-party accounts of an individual&#x2019;s philosophical outlook. Overall, most cases are quite clear, I believe, but some will demand a degree of subjective interpretation.</p>
<p>Lastly, in reviewing the many cases for panpsychism, one notices over and over again a striking fact: that there is almost no recognition of panpsychist predecessors. In other words, most philosophers cited here seem to operate in a vacuum; they appear to have no knowledge of the long and lustrous history of panpsychism. They typically cite no one&#x2014;or at most, one or two individuals. They relate few relevant accounts of earlier panpsychist theories. In essence, they almost act as if they were the only panpsychist in history.</p>
<p>This seems odd to us modern philosophers, who are so steeped in careful research, precise citation, and a deep knowledge of our fields. But philosophers of the past were less concerned about such things. They wanted to convey penetrating insight, new ideas, and metaphysical visions. They saw little need to quote extensively, to show exactly how their ideas stacked up to their predecessors, or to demonstrate encyclopedic knowledge. There were exceptions, of course&#x2014;Aristotle comes immediately to mind&#x2014;but for the most part, the great thinkers of the past were concerned with imparting their own ideas, not those of others.</p>
<p>From a present-day perspective, this presents us with a fractured and disconnected story. We move from one individual to another, and from one era to the next, with seemingly little continuity. Theories and arguments appear at one time, vanish for awhile, recur in different form, vanish again, only to return in yet new garb later on. In my recounting of this history, I will try to fill in the gaps and provide the continuity that is lacking in our primary sources.</p>
<p>With this background in place, we can now begin to examine in detail the evolution of panpsychist thought from the time of the pre-Socratics through the present.</p>
