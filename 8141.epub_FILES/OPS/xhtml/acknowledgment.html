<p class="chtitle"><a id="page_vii"></a>Acknowledgments</p>
<p class="noindent">We owe thanks for suggestions and tolerance to all of the usual suspects&#8212;family, friends, colleagues, and research assistants. We particularly want to recognize and thank three of our colleagues in ICT policy. Milton Mueller was a co-author on an earlier paper on which <a href="chapter09.html">chapter 9</a> draws heavily. Donald Abelson joined us as a co-author of the summary. John Richards was the perfect sounding board, agreeing and disagreeing with our arguments and provoking us to refine our thinking as the chapters took shape. <a href="chapter08.html">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="chapter09.html">9</a> also draw heavily on papers that he co-authored with us. And he read the final manuscript and provided us with insightful suggestions and criticisms. Many people shared their ideas with us; a substantial number did so &#8220;off the record.&#8221; We thank those anonymous sources and these who were on the record: Don Abelson, Francois Bar, Michael Borrus, Carlos Casasus, Manuel Castells, Bob Conn, Cory Doctorow, Kenneth Cukier, Pierre de Vries, Gerald Faulhaber, Eric Gan, Don Gips, Scott Harris, Reed Hundt, David Hytha, Mimi Ito, Michael Kleeman, Zhong Yuan Li, Paul Maritz, Cory Ondrejka, Robert Pepper, Peter Preuss, Nicholas Pujet, Howard Rheingold, Gregory Rosston, Sachio Semmoto, Larry Smarr, Simon Wilkie, and John Zysman. We also thank Cindy Hwang, Piyoo Kochar, Emilie Lasserson, Federica Marchesi, and Meg Young for research assistance. None of these friends and critics is responsible for any errors of fact or argument that may remain.</p>
<p class="noindent">For family (Margaret, Megan, Joan, Adam, and Zach) and mentors (Robert O. Keohane and in memory of Ernst B. Haas). All of them &#8220;inflection points&#8221; in our lives.</p>
