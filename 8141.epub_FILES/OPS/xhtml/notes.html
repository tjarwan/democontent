<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
<p class="notetxt1"><a id="fn1" href="introduction.html#rfn1">1.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The Internet decisively moved networking to schemes in which the intelligence organizing the network and its applications moved from centralized telephone switches to millions of computers at the edge of a decentralized, digital packet network. This accelerated innovation, because the programming of the telephone switched network no longer was a roadblock to new applications. It also began true convergence among applications, because (to paraphrase the popular Internet slogan) every application&#8212;voice calls, emails, or video&#8212;is just a digital bit on a packet network.</p>

<p class="notetxt1"><a id="ch02_1" href="chapter02.html#rfn1">1.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;IBM was late to the party. In 1977, the Apple II, Commodore International&#8217;s PET, and Tandy&#8217;s TRS 80 were the first successful pre-built minicomputers. The Computer History Museum identifies the Kenbak-1 (introduced in 1971) as the first personal computer, but only about 40 were ever built.</p>
<p class="notetxt1"><a id="ch02_2" href="chapter02.html#rfn2">2.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The FCC unanimously found that the AT&#38;T tariff preventing interconnection was illegal and ordered AT&#38;T and other phone companies to allow interconnection of devices to their networks that did not cause actual harm. See Gerald W. Brock, <i>Telecommunication Policy for the Information Age</i> (Harvard University Press, 1994), pp. 84, 85.</p>
<p class="notetxt1"><a id="ch02_3" href="chapter02.html#rfn3">3.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Electronic switching began to supplant mechanical switches. The first digital electronic switch, an AT&#38;T 4ESS, was put into service in Chicago on January 16, 1976 (source: <a href="http://www.corp.att.com">http://www.corp.att.com</a>.)</p>
<p class="notetxt1"><a id="ch02_4" href="chapter02.html#rfn4">4.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The advent of satellite communications services in the 1960s led to great improvement in long-distance telephone service and, later, broadcast transmission into the home. At first such services did little for data transmission. Fiber-optic transmission began to enter the network in 1977, when AT&#38;T installed fiber telephone systems in Chicago and GTE began providing service in Boston (source: <a href="http://www.fiber-optics.info">http://www.fiber-optics.info</a>).</p>

In 1959, Texas Instruments and Fairchild introduced the integrated circuit. During the 1960s, integrated <a id="page_271"></a>circuits became microprocessors. In 1971, Intel created the microprocessor. IBM introduced its Personal Computer in 1981. In 1986, Cisco introduced the TCP/IP router. Source: Alfred D.

<p class="notetxt1"><a id="ch02_8" href="chapter02.html#rfn8">8.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Even with increased transmission capacity, most Quality of Service guarantees were done on specialized network overlays (virtual private network or private network). Megabits and megabytes are frequently confused. In most instances bits are used to talk about data transfer rates. Bytes generally are used to talk about storage size calculations. Specifically, 1 kilobit = 1,000 bits, 1 byte = 8 bits, 1 kilobyte = 1,024 bytes, and 1 megabyte = 1,024 kilobytes. If an Internet provider offers a &#8220;1-Mb&#8221; connection, it is megabits, not megabytes. To determine approximately how much is being downloaded, divide by 8&#8212;for example, a speed of 1 megabit per second will result in downloads of 128 kilobytes of data.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_13" href="chapter02.html#rfn13">13.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The global electronics market and the telecommunications equipment market were under pressure from Japanese and later Taiwanese and Korean exporters that relied on scale economies. The semiconductor challenge moved the US closer to industrial policy than at any time except wartime. The strategy was to shore up US firms by two strategies. First, the US tried to increase its firms&#8217; market penetration in Japan, so they could build scale economies and pressure Japanese price margins at home. This was the point of the US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. The second goal was to share the cost of maintaining the supplier infrastructure for integrated American chip producers. The proposed idea was Sematech, a consortium jointly funded by industry and the US government. On the US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, see Peter Cowhey and Jonathan Aronson, <i>Managing the World Economy</i> <a id="page_272"></a>(Council on Foreign Relations, 1993), pp. 139&#8211;145.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_15" href="chapter02.html#rfn15">15.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The effort in the late 1990s to force incumbent local-service carriers to share their network elements on an unbundled, cost-related basis was the ultimate effort to achieve disintegration through government intervention. Competition in most countries diverged from the US model of splitting the local and long-distance elements of the monopolist. Those with vigorous regulators, such as the EU, did focus on these carriers&#8217; local-service networks as the most enduring part of their former market control.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_16" href="chapter02.html#rfn16">16.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;For example, Korea and Taiwan used industrial policies to steer high national savings rates into subsidies for specialized entry into capital intensive and lower return segments of the memory chip industry.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_18" href="chapter02.html#rfn18">18.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;In Japan, this innovation storm&#8212;driven by lower costs, flexible networking, and user co-invention&#8212;was absent. Japan continued to favor vertical integration anchored on the technological planning of the dominant carrier, NTT. Although Japan also introduced telecom services competition, it limited the impact of competition by placing all new entrants under a micro-managed price umbrella set by NTT. Network expansion plans need ministry approval because the government wished to sustain its subsidy scheme for electronics firms Japan required the licensing of value-added networks. It did not license a network embracing Internet protocols until 1992.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_23" href="chapter02.html#rfn23">23.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The split between presidential and parliamentary systems on incentives for delegation of authority is fundamental. However, the systems differ in their behavior based on such factors as the design of electoral voting systems. And some countries use hybrids systems. See Royce Carroll and Matthew S&#248;berg Shugart, &#8220;Neo-Madisonian Theory and Latin American Institutions,&#8221; in <i>Regimes and Democracy in Latin America</i>, ed. G. Munck (Oxford University Press, 2007).</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_24" href="chapter02.html#rfn24">24.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;A final form of control over the FCC is the division of some of its powers with other branches of the government. The most important of these is the shared power over competition policy with the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. In view of the strength of US antitrust laws, both political parties are sensitive to the possibility of the rival party politicizing competition policy when it controls the federal government. As a result, the career officials in the Antitrust Division enjoy a relatively high level of protection from routine political oversight. Decisions on the general criteria for when to prosecute are subject to guidance by a political appointee, but the president is generally circumspect on antitrust matters. The shared power of Justice and FCC over telecom mergers leads the FCC to be careful not to conflict with Justice. It can happen, however, as the late 2006 ATT&#8211;SBC merger decisions show.</p>

Between 1900 and 1933, as national industrial and network markets took form, state authorities used antitrust actions to shelter local competitors from national competitors that held advantages over them. Most senators from these states were wary of nationally dominant firms. America&#8217;s veto-oriented system and Congress&#8217;s distrust of sweeping regulatory powers dampened impulses toward national economic planning. Industrial policy that might have concentrated firms into a few national champions was difficult to pass.</p>

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_28" href="chapter02.html#rfn28">28.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;James Cortada reports various estimates of ICT as the costs of the largest banks (<i>The Digital Hand</i>, volume 2, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 33 and 89&#8211;90). His estimates are in the range of 7&#8211;15% of the total costs of the banks. As late as 1992, after networking costs had declined dramatically from the 1970s, networking costs were 10% of the total. Interviewing and documents supplied to the authors in the 1980s showed that during the 1970s networking costs were much higher.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_29" href="chapter02.html#rfn29">29.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;As described in <a href="chapter03.html">chapter 3</a>, these changes were part of the broader transition to a service economy that eventually made sophisticated manufacturing into a part of service product schemes, as clearly has happened in ICT since 2000.</p>

Despite grumbling from the Republican Congress, the FCC used its discretion to institute a new fee for telecom services to fund the establishment of Internet access for schools, libraries, and hospitals. This was a conscious decision to meet the political demands to keep service widely distributed to all areas, but the Democrats designed the subsidy so that it went as much to poor urban neighborhoods as it did to rural areas. Inevitably, coverage of middle class areas was part of the political bargain.</p>

Conservative Republicans cast this as enhancing competition by taking regulatory shackles off the Bells.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch02_52" href="chapter02.html#rfn52">52.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Another effort to promote international competition was the decision to introduce competition in satellite communications. Intelsat, formed in 1964 at US instigation to manage global satellite communications, was a &#8220;monopoly of monopolies&#8221; for international satellite services. Each national telecom monopolies owned a share of Intelsat proportionate to its international use. The US was a partial exception. It created a private national satellite monopoly, Comsat, to represent its interests instead of tapping AT&#38;T. But in 1983, as domestic deregulation was gaining momentum in the US, a new venture, Orion Satellite Corporation sought permission from the FCC to launch a transatlantic satellite service in competition with Intelsat. Overcoming fierce opposition by Comsat and Intelsat, in late 1984 President Reagan determined &#8220;that separate international communication systems are required in the national interests,&#8221; but promised it would consult and coordinate with Intelsat to make entry smooth. The FCC then ruled that private firms should be allowed to provide international satellite communication services in competition with Comsat and Intelsat. In 1988 PanAmSat finally broke the Intelsat/Comsat stranglehold on international satellite services.

Yet the impetus for the vision is clear. Since the early 1980s large companies&#8217; use of powerful computers has increased more than tenfold and perhaps as much as a hundredfold because they assigned a separate server to each new application. Consequently, these companies use only 10&#8211;15% of the effective capacity of their computers. Large financial institutions are key early adopters of the Grid.

During the 1990s, SAP, PeopleSoft (Oracle), and related systems were deployed. Recently enterprise buyers focused on efforts to broaden the impact of these investments across the business. Customer demands for data interoperability and ease of use required changes in products and approach from software vendors. The use of xml file formats in Microsoft Office 2007 is one example of this trend. System vendors to enterprises have to support at least three major operating systems with the Web browser as the common interface.</p>

Modularity is an idealized characterization of several important underlying properties. Today, some end systems, like personal computers, approximate the pure ideal. So the overall vector of the ICT networked infrastructure is toward modularity. Pierre de Vries pointed out to us that a purely modular architecture for ICT would be partial (no module is self-sufficient for the end service), separable (each module is self-contained and detachable), and substitutable (another module can be substituted).

Data use includes surges in peak demand tied to peer-to-peer media applications downloaded by human users. Still, there is a limit to how many data search requests and YouTube videos anybody can absorb. Although &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; traffic will be important, new forms of &#8220;last stop is human&#8221; and &#8220;no human in the loop&#8221; applications will emerge to drive data traffic. Pilot deployments of the latest network-centric war-fighting applications suggest that large data requirements will emerge in which machines generate traffic without humans in the loop at all times. New traffic management systems have car GPS systems provide real-time feedback to traffic monitors on congestion and speeds that is then aggregated and displayed to individual drivers.</p>

Otherwise Apple could control the retail channel so that as users bought more Apple music the cost to switch to a competitor&#8217;s device soars. We thank Cory Doctorow for this point.

Consider the highly specialized, proprietary technology shops that design components for systems producers and systems users. These companies control system segments characterized by fast innovation, deep intellectual property, and extreme specialization. Some firms, like Qualcomm, are pure specialists. Others players are divisions of larger conglomerates like Samsung&#8217;s operations on large display systems. Samsung may choose to control its own display panel manufacturing, but this is a strategic choice, not a necessity for a specialized innovation strategy. Qualcomm is a purer example than Samsung of a technology input specialist because it does not also sell end-product systems.</p>

Customized ODM phones for Orange allowed tighter hardware-applied service integration for Orange in France and raised revenues by $18 per month. ODMs also allowed Microsoft to circumvent the Big-3 backed Symbian operating system. Since mobiles have key open standards at the network layer, the industry may be heading to a model like that of the automobile industry, where a &#8220;system integrator&#8221; like Honda may combine horizontal layers of value added so no player dominates any layer.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch04_72" href="chapter04.html#rfn72">72.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The European road traffic system is an example of a vertically integrated solution that relies on low turnover infrastructure and a narrow solution. Turnover is low because transaction costs are high. Building agreement on a system is politically complex. Initially, competition may be inefficient in many comparable niches. See Peter F. Cowhey and Jonathan David Aronson, &#8220;Wireless standards and applications&#8212;Industrial strategies and government policy,&#8221; Annenberg Research Network on International Communication, 2004.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch04_73" href="chapter04.html#rfn73">73.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Although asset specific solutions for business processes may be stable in particular niches, controlling an expensive, hard to replace facility may not be enough to guarantee this result. Consider the situation of telecom carriers that still control local transmission facilities. Despite this control, prices of voice packages are decreasing and likely will continue to do so. The reasons are that there is substitution among modes of communications to provide the specific user service (a phone call) and that multi-sided platform economics makes the phone call into just one of several uses and prices on the platform. However, new entrants leverage modular software and the installed capital stock to deliver tailored multi-sided platform offerings quickly. For a general treatment, see Varian et al., <i>Economics of Information Technology</i>, pp. 21&#8211;28.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch04_74" href="chapter04.html#rfn74">74.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;There are ways of attacking complex legacy systems. For example, the software code for telephone switches was costly to create. Once established, the code that permitted reliable phone service was huge and difficult for competitors to understand. Vendors still sell this equipment at huge discounts in anticipation of customer lock-in for service and upgrades because it was so hard to crack the code. Today more powerful computational devices offer service applications built on relatively open software standards, like the marriage of routers to VoIP software, thereby pressuring traditional producers of network equipment.</p>

Indeed, the fishing fleet would do better in the short run if it kept fishing while everyone else limited its catches. In short, often it is logical not to cooperate even if there are long-term gains to be realized.</p>

The tree starts at the end in a bargaining game and then works inductively backwards. Implicitly or explicitly, strategic actors think about the end game and shape current decisions in light of it. Spatial models consider policy choices in one or two dimensions (e.g., more or less money and more or less centralization of authority) and then map player preferences on them. The decision rules (does a player have a veto, for example) plus the preference clustering allow predictions about the range of outcomes. This analysis uses these insights informally.</p>

Mexico decided to end Telmex&#8217;s monopoly on long-distance services after 1996. The growth of heterogeneous demand in Mexico had generated marketplace conditions that favored entry by focused firms to fill specific demand niches. This situation provided domestic support for reform in Mexico and incentives for US specialized players to back regional liberalization.

See A. Acedo, &#8220;Opportunities in Mexico,&#8221; presented at International Telecom Competition Seminar,&#8221; Seattle, 1997. The NAFTA deal ensured the provision of private leased circuits on a flat-rate basis, the key to allowing a computer network to get a cheap, fixed rate for transmission capacity and then use advanced engineering to carry more data than the typical telecom circuit. Unlike NAFTA, the 1997 WTO offer included public networks; see Peter Cowhey and John Richards, &#8220;Deregulating and liberalising the North American telecommunications market: Explaining the US approach,&#8221; in <i>Trade, Investment and Competition Policies in the Global Economy</i>, ed.

This fundamental reform was implemented by a rule that allowed countries to recognize one another&#8217;s certification of the safety of equipment (mutual recognition agreements). Mutual recognition promised to relieve equipment suppliers from slow and expensive procedures to get technical certification for their products in each individual country. Implementation of these agreements was often contentious, as was the case with Mexico.</p>

Services like traditional phone calls require the use of telephone network switches. (Here the adaptation to VoIP and similar technological innovations is omitted.) If settlement rates sound arcane, the system was more complicated in all its bureaucratic glory. As a matter of economic analysis it is simpler and more accurate to focus on the settlement rate. For the full complexities, see Peter Cowhey, &#8220;FCC benchmarks and the reform of the international telecommunications market,&#8221; <i>Telecommunications Policy</i> 22 (1998), no. 11: 899&#8211;911.</p>

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch07_28" href="chapter07.html#rfn28">28.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;In 1995 the FCC formalized its rules governing foreign entry into the US market for basic telecommunications services in the form of the Effective Competitive Opportunities (ECO) test. It believed this test was fairer than past practices and could permit substantial opening. It still considered this route to be inferior to a multilateral trade agreement. Foreign governments disliked the test. They saw it as an intrusive examination of their domestic regulatory practices. However, the ECO tests foreshadowed the regulatory principles adopted in the subsequent WTO agreement on telecommunications services. The Commission intentionally cast ECO in a manner designed to signal the rules it would consider necessary for a satisfactory WTO agreement.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch07_31" href="chapter07.html#rfn31">31.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Put differently, settlement rates that far exceeded costs created the possibility of anti-competitive behavior in the provision of US international services. This would harm consumers and erode market efficiency over time. The FCC provided an operational definition of two forms of anti-competitive behavior. On the problems and the remedies, see Federal Communications Commission, &#8220;In the matter of international settlement rates, report and order,&#8221; IB docket 96-261, 1997, paragraphs 211&#8211;259.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch07_32" href="chapter07.html#rfn32">32.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Many worrisome tactics were variations on the strategy of &#8220;one-way bypass.&#8221; This occurred if the home market of a foreign carrier licensed to provide services in the US required US carriers to terminate at the settlement rate while the foreign carrier terminated traffic into the US at the rates prevailing under &#8220;flexibility.&#8221; Thus, country X might charge 39 cents as the settlement rate to terminate US traffic while its carrier could terminate traffic into the US at 6 cents using leased transmission lines without paying a settlement rate. This would drive up US net settlement payments and escalate the price of international services for US consumers. A WTO agreement made this scenario probable if the US agreed to liberalize licensing of <a id="page_310"></a>international leased circuits, but most WTO countries had not. For details, see Cowhey, &#8220;FCC benchmarks.&#8221;</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch07_33" href="chapter07.html#rfn33">33.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;By contrast, carriers from less competitive markets worried that trade reforms would cut into their large profit margins from international services.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch08_25" href="chapter08.html#rfn25">25.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;National and regional standard-setting processes varied. Effective participation required a significant commercial presence and the ability to fund staffers who could spend extensive time on the standard-setting process. Voting, if used, often was weighted according to market revenues and required super-majorities of 60% or more. In contrast to the one company-one vote principle used by the US Telecommunications Industry Association, the ETSI used weighted voting. Market revenues mattered significantly in the weighting. Manufacturers dominated the voting. In 1997, 49.5% of the members were manufacturers, 15.8% were public network operators, 9.18% were national government authorities, and 12.4% were research bodies.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch08_32" href="chapter08.html#rfn32">32.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The most important dispute involved Qualcomm and Ericsson in litigation that began in 1995. This was resolved in an agreement announced on March 25, 1999, that included cross-licensing of patents and Ericsson&#8217;s purchase of Qualcomm&#8217;s terrestrial infrastructure business. Vitally, from the viewpoint of Qualcomm, the agreement included a stipulation that licensing would be done for all three proposed versions of 3G. This settlement allowed commercialization to proceed but other patent battles continued through 2008 that pitted Qualcomm against Broadcom and Nokia on control of patents and licensing terms.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch08_33" href="chapter08.html#rfn33">33.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Traditionally, some standard-setting organizations, including the ITU, demanded &#8220;royalty-free licensing.&#8221; Many others now require &#8220;reasonable and nondiscriminatory&#8221; licensing. This discussion relies on Patterson 2002. In 2000 the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau stated: &#8220;The patent holder is not prepared to waive his rights but would be willing to negotiate licenses with parties on a nondiscriminatory basis on reasonable terms and conditions.&#8221; The bureau does not set precise criteria for these conditions and leaves it to negotiations among the parties. The relevant factors for setting royalties include development and manufacturing costs plus profits. See Mark R. Patterson, &#8220;Invention, Industry Standards, and Intellectual Property,&#8221; <i>Berkeley Technology Law Journal</i> 17 (2002), no. 3: 1053&#8211;1054 and n. 40.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="ch08_34" href="chapter08.html#rfn34">34.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;In 2002 another group of European vendors announced that it would set an absolute cap, at a relatively low level, on royalties charged for W-CDMA technology use. Qualcomm quietly rejected the cap and observed that it held about 50% of the IP on W-CDMA, thus making any royalty offer that it did not agree to meaningless. Other companies rejected Qualcomm&#8217;s estimate of its holdings. This set the stage for royalty disputes extending through 2008.</p>

The 802.16-2004 standard relies extensively on &#8220;OFDM&#8221; to provide fixed wireless service, either to small businesses or as backhaul for cellular networks. This garnered considerable attention in 2004 but it is incompatible with 802.16e, the center of attention for Intel and Samsung, which relies on &#8220;OFDMA&#8221; to serve mobile users.

Qualcomm has faced legal complaints that it manipulated its IPR to favor its chip-making operation over its rivals. Complaints by Nokia, Ericsson, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, NEC, and Panasonic were filed with European, Korean, and the US competition and trade authorities that Qualcomm is trying to vertically leverage its IPR, much as Microsoft did. Qualcomm denies this. They have also filed suits claiming Qualcomm violated their patents. In 2006 Nokia and Qualcomm deadlocked on cross-licensing GSM and CDMA technology patents. The stakes were large. Business analysts estimated that Nokia could end up paying $1 billion per year in royalties if terms did not change. In 2007 Qualcomm had several setbacks in these legal battles although the severity of the losses remained unclear.

This influenced the dynamic of Internet standard setting. The IETF is treated as a &#8220;virtual agent,&#8221; not created by governments but requiring a decision by governments not to displace it by more traditional institutions with overlapping jurisdiction. This potential for governments to change IETF&#8217;s effective jurisdiction had implications for its operations.

The World Wide Web Consortium develops standards recommendations for the Web. The Consortium was founded when commercial interest in the creation of the Web was strong, as was government attention. Tim Berners-Lee, the key architect of the Web, writes that the desire of all players to avoid capture of key tools and design guidelines by any one company (i.e., Microsoft) made it easier for the Consortium to operate as an open standards-setting body. (See T. Berners-Lee, <i>Weaving the Web</i>, Harper Business, 2000.) Unlike the IETF, the W3C has membership dues and does some centralized development work of design tools.</p>

Network designs differ on how they handle this problem. Parnas observes that hierarchy is one solution for conserving time and effort (one module orders the others) and, if done properly, hierarchy may actually make the lower level functions in the network more resistant to disruption. Chopping off the head does not hurt the rest of the body, only the highest level reasoning. The Internet&#8217;s domain name system (DNS) handles the problem of assigning unique names in precisely this way.</p>

For technical and political reasons, the continuing growth of the Internet has led to more resource assignment functions occurring at specialized regional authorities, such as those for North America, Africa, and Latin America. For example, this discussion omits detailed discussion of the role of regional address registries and other functional elements of the Internet. However, these arrangements fit in with the concept of a chain of <a id="page_329"></a>delegation and with the general US policy of internationalization through privatization. The two most important non US-based address registries (for Europe and Asia-Pacific) were delegated to external nonprofits before the creation of ICANN. In both cases, delegations of address resources to non-US actors was a conscious part of an attempt to promote the spread of Internet protocol by reassuring foreign actors that the US was willing to share control.</p>

<p class="notetxt"><a id="summ21" href="summary.html#rfn21">21.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;As we noted in <a href="chapter08.html">chapter 8</a>, strategic game playing over spectrum is routine. The same game is being played out between 3G and WiMAX advocates today. Spectrum should be flexible.

The goal was to <a id="page_334"></a>provide a simple, clear set of guidelines addressing the public Internet markets for broadband access. We have slightly modified them by eliminating the call for competitive facilities (see our earlier discussion) and adding the requirements on wholesale and terminal equipment and applications. Atkinson and Weiser suggest comparable guidelines based on their independent analysis of the challenges.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="summ35" href="summary.html#rfn35">35.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;Network operators providing basic access should not insert themselves in the traffic stream by blocking or degrading traffic. Traffic should be carried regardless of content or destination, and operators should not give preferential treatment to their own content in the basic access service.</p>
<p class="notetxt"><a id="summ36" href="summary.html#rfn36">36.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;The specific parameters (speed and latency) of this service could be reviewed on a quadrennial basis.

<p class="notetxt"><a id="summ37" href="summary.html#rfn37">37.</a> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;There are issues that are central to broadband competition in developing country markets that this package does not address.
