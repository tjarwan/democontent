<h2 class="h2a"><em>IMMEDIACY: HOW WORD CHOICE AND NONVERBAL CUES AFFECT THE<br/>RELATIONSHIP</em></h2>
<p class="chapauthor">Bruce A. Berger and Amanda K. Diggs</p>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we will examine how the words we choose influence the nature and quality of pharmacists&#8217; relationships with their patients. We will then examine how nonverbal cues can enhance or detract from the quality of pharmacist&#8211;patient therapeutic relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">By listening carefully to the way people say things, we can quickly recognize that a speaker&#8217;s choice of words reveals a wealth of information about the speaker&#8217;s true feelings or attitudes toward a topic, event, or person. Even when speakers skillfully try to disguise their feelings and emotions, particular attention to the speaker&#8217;s word choice can reveal true intentions or motivations. This chapter will describe principles that pharmacists can use to make inferences about patients&#8217; feelings or attitudes toward a topic, event, or person. Equally important, the chapter will provide principles pharmacists can use to craft more efficient and effective messages for their patients.</p>
<h3 class="h3">VERBAL IMMEDIACY</h3>
<p class="noindent">In 1968, Wiener and Mehrabian<sup><a id="ch14-ref1" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref1">1</a></sup> described verbal immediacy as a model of communication that analyzes variations in word use as a basis for inferring different feelings or attitudes of the speaker. For example, a pharmacist could say, &#8220;You and I should discuss your options&#8221; or &#8220;We should discuss your options.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Through careful examination of messages that appear to say the same thing, but with different words, we can infer different feelings or attitudes on the part of the speaker. The variations in word choice indicate different degrees of separation from the object of the speaker&#8217;s <a id="page_184"/>communication. &#8220;You and I&#8221; may be equivalent in meaning to &#8220;we,&#8221; but the &#8220;we&#8221; statement represents more immediate communication than the &#8220;you and I&#8221; statement. The &#8220;you and I&#8221; statement is an example of nonimmediacy. It is considered nonimmediate because it uses two symbols (&#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221;) to designate two separate entities when the language provides the option of using only one symbol (&#8220;we&#8221;).</p>

<p class="indent">Verbal immediacy refers to the degree of separation created between the speaker and the object of the speaker&#8217;s communication as a result of the particular words used by the speaker. Inferences can be drawn about speakers&#8217; feelings concerning the things they are communicating about, their communication, or the listeners.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHY DO WE USE NONIMMEDIATE LANGUAGE?</h3>
<p class="noindent">Wiener and Mehrabian use the term nonimmediacy to refer to &#8220;any indication of separation, nonidentity, attenuation of directness, or change in intensity of interaction&#8221; among the communicator, the listener, the object of communication, or the communication itself. Nonimmediacy represents a speaker&#8217;s attempt to separate himself or herself from the object of the communication, from the listener, or from the communication. This separation can be construed to represent avoidance behavior motivated by a negative emotional state toward the object, listener, or communication. In other words, nonimmediacy represents an individual&#8217;s attempt to avoid identifying with unpleasant objects, persons, or topics. Nonimmediacy is a technique for distancing yourself from objects, events, persons, or topics that you&#8217;d rather avoid.</p>
<p class="indent">Often, feelings and emotions cannot be easily expressed in words. In fact, in most cultures restraints are imposed on communication regarding emotion, evaluation, or preference in general.<sup><a id="ch14-ref2" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref2">2</a></sup> This is true particularly concerning the expression of negative feelings and emotions, evaluation, or preference.</p>
<h3 class="h3">NONIMMEDIACY AND THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER</h3>
<p class="noindent">Von Friederichs-Fitzwater<sup><a id="ch14-ref3" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref3">3</a></sup> studied the use of verbally immediate language in conversations between health care providers and terminally ill patients. Von Friederichs-Fitzwater&#8217;s review of the literature revealed that health care providers are uncomfortable when communicating with dying patients.<sup><a href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref3">3</a></sup> Furthermore, health care providers are uncomfortable <a id="page_185"/>discussing the topics of death and dying. That analysis showed that health care providers used far more nonimmediate language than the dying patients they cared for. This is evidence that communicating with dying patients represents an essential but difficult task for health care professionals. The study showed that dying patients did use some nonimmediate language in their communications with health care providers. Like health care providers, patients use nonimmediate language as a means of dealing with uncomfortable feelings. The researcher suggested that patients&#8217; use of nonimmediate language may be connected to their fears of abandonment, pain, loss of independence, or fear of the unknown. This further suggests that patients and health care providers may choose to use more nonimmediate language in an effort to protect feelings of vulnerability, guilt, or resentment.</p>
<p class="indent">In that study, the differences between the verbal immediacy scores of physicians, nurses, and hospice workers were not significant. This suggests that hospice workers and nurses are as uncomfortable as physicians in communicating with dying patients. Perhaps all the health care providers included in the study used nonimmediacy or distancing behavior as a means of coping with such an emotionally taxing situation as death and dying.</p>
<h3 class="h3">IMPLICATIONS FOR PHARMACISTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, health care providers&#8217; communication with patients is marked by a climate of distance and aloofness. Like other health care professionals, pharmacists may be using nonimmediate language when communicating with particular patients or when discussing difficult or unpleasant topics, issues, or events. The use of nonimmediate language may hamper the establishment of healthy, trusting therapeutic relationships with patients. In addition, the use of nonimmediate language may prove detrimental when trying to build rapport with patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacists should consider adopting a more immediate style of communication. They should use more immediate language to help build therapeutic relationships with patients. Pharmacists are in a unique position to be the health care providers who create environments where patients feel comfortable enough to communicate openly and honestly about their health-related concerns and issues. This niche is currently unfilled by other health care providers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">STEPS TO MORE IMMEDIATE LANGUAGE</h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Step 1a: Identify topics and issues that make you uncomfortable.</strong> Make a list of topics, issues, objects, and events that you find difficult to discuss or that make you uncomfortable. Here are some examples: <a id="page_186"/>death and dying, cancer, AIDS, sexual dysfunction. You should be more specific in your list.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Step 1b: Identify groups and persons with whom you feel uncomfortable.</strong> Make a list of groups and individuals who make you feel uncomfortable and with whom you find it difficult to communicate. Again, be more specific than the following examples: minority groups, mentally challenged people, physically challenged people, people suffering from specific diseases.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Step 2: Identify nonimmediate language when it is spoken.</strong> Wiener and Mehrabian devised six categories for identifying nonimmediate language. This chapter outlines three very basic categories for identifying nonimmediate language (symbol used, us versus them, and temporal). Remember that nonimmediate language works to separate the speaker from the listener or from the object or subject spoken about. Nonimmediacy serves as a means of exclusion rather than inclusion. Therefore, nonimmediate language hinders rapport building, because it excludes either the pharmacist or the patient. Exclusive communication reveals negative feelings and emotions and alludes to treatment that is not personal.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Symbol used</em>.</strong> The &#8220;symbol used&#8221; category of nonimmediacy examines the symbols that take the place of the referent or word and the adjectives used to describe words. The more ambiguous or nonspecific the symbols used, the more nonimmediate the language.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice the words you use as symbols for people, places, objects, events, and so on. For example, when referring to Mrs. Henderson, you may select the symbol &#8220;my patient,&#8221; &#8220;a patient,&#8221; or &#8220;the person&#8221;&#8212;in decreasing degrees of immediacy. The final symbol, &#8220;the person,&#8221; represents the greatest degree of separation of the pharmacist from the patient. It expresses the most negative degree of emotion and feeling about Mrs. Henderson.</p>
<p class="indent">The symbols for people, objects, and events being communicated are often pronouns. The less specific the symbol, the more nonimmediate the communication. For example, if the pharmacist asks why the patient smokes, the patient might give the following responses:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I smoke because I enjoy it. (most immediate)<br/>We smoke because we enjoy it.<br/>One smokes because one enjoys it.<br/>You (you meaning I) smoke because you enjoy it. (least immediate)</p>
<p class="indentt">The patient&#8217;s increasing nonimmediacy is a means of separating himself from the subject of the communication. The symbols become less and less specific.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_187"/>In another example, a pharmacist might respond, regarding a pharmacy convention that he or she attended:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I discussed the new legislation. (most immediate)<br/>We discussed the new legislation.<br/>Pharmacists discussed the new legislation.<br/>There was a discussion of the new legislation. (least immediate)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Or, a pharmacist might say to a patient:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Remember, we said that you should come in for a checkup. (most immediate)<br/>Remember, you said that you would come in for a checkup.<br/>Remember, it was said that you should come in for a checkup. (least immediate)</p>
<p class="indentt">When you substitute words such as &#8220;everyone&#8221; for &#8220;I,&#8221; you indicate nonimmediacy and nonidentity with the object of the communication. In such instances, the speaker works to exclude himself or herself from the object or subject of the communication. For example, a pharmacist says, &#8220;Mrs. Jones, I noticed that you&#8217;re 5 days late on your blood pressure medicine.&#8221; The patient replies:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I forget to take my medication sometimes. (most immediate) Everyone forgets to take their medications sometimes. (least immediate)</p>
<p class="indentt">To assess the immediacy of your use of symbols in communication with patients, answer the question, Do I include or exclude myself when I communicate with patients? For example:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Am I more likely to refer to a patient as &#8220;my patient&#8221; or &#8220;the patient&#8221;?</p>
<p class="blockquote">When talking about a patient&#8217;s problem(s), am I more likely to refer to the patient&#8217;s problem as &#8220;my problem,&#8221; &#8220;our problem,&#8221; &#8220;your problem,&#8221; or &#8220;their problem&#8221;?</p>
<p class="indentt">The terms &#8220;my&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; are considered more immediate than &#8220;your&#8221; or &#8220;their.&#8221; Use of the terms &#8220;my&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; includes, rather than excludes, the pharmacist. By using &#8220;my&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; in discussing a patient&#8217;s problem, the pharmacist takes responsibility and participates in the process with the patient. This can be a very effective in building rapport. The use of these terms indicates to the patient that he or she <a id="page_188"/>does not have to deal with the problem alone. Rather, the patient can infer that he or she has a partner.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, use of the terms &#8220;your&#8221; and &#8220;their&#8221; excludes the pharmacist from the problem. Using &#8220;your problem&#8221; or &#8220;their problem&#8221; separates the pharmacist from the problem. Patients can infer that they must deal with the problem alone.</p>
<p class="indent">When discussing a patient&#8217;s options, are you more likely to say, &#8220;You and I should discuss your options&#8221; or &#8220;We should discuss your options&#8221;? &#8220;You and I&#8221; represents more nonimmediate language than &#8220;we.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8221; represents more inclusive communication than &#8220;you and I.&#8221; Using &#8220;you and I&#8221; signifies the pharmacist&#8217;s attempt to separate himself or herself from the patient.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Us versus them</em>.</strong> The &#8220;us versus them&#8221; category of nonimmediacy describes the relationship between the communicator and the object of the communication in terms of space and time (here and now versus far away and long ago). Words denoting time and space clearly identify the degree of separation between the communicator and the object.</p>
<p class="indent">To assess your use of these indicators of nonimmediacy, ask yourself, Do I try to include my patients or exclude them in my communication endeavors? The first step in identifying nonimmediate language in this category is to notice when you use the term &#8220;that&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;this,&#8221; or &#8220;those&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;these.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">For example, the pharmacist says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand those people&#8221; or &#8220;when those people are in the same room.&#8221; &#8220;Those&#8221; is considered nonimmediate because it signifies separation between the speaker and the object of the communication. The use of the word &#8220;those&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;these&#8221; may be interpreted as signifying the speaker&#8217;s negative emotions, evaluations, or lack of personal feelings about &#8220;those&#8221; people.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_189"/><strong><em>Temporal</em>.</strong> The temporal category of nonimmediacy describes the relationship between the speaker and the object of the communication in terms of time. The speaker separates himself or herself from the object of communication by using language that refers to the past or future as opposed to the present. Note your use of adverbial clauses introduced by &#8220;when,&#8221; &#8220;during,&#8221; or &#8220;while.&#8221; For example, the pharmacist might say:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Do you feel offended <em>when people talk about your cancer</em>? (least immediate)<br/>Would you feel offended if we talked about your cancer? (more immediate)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Do you feel embarrassed <em>while receiving information about your birth control</em>? (least immediate)<br/>Would discussing your birth control prescription with me embarrass you? (more immediate)</p>
<p class="blockquote"><em>During your visits with me</em>, can you and I begin to discuss your concerns about your disease? (least immediate)<br/>Can we begin to discuss concerns you may have about this disease? (more immediate)</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Step 3: Identify when and with whom you use nonimmediate language.</strong> As in step 1, make lists: I do this when rushed, stressed, anxious or nervous, irritated, frightened, uncertain. I do this with Mrs. Peach (she&#8217;s mean and unpleasant), Mr. Doe (he has severe facial burns and his appearance frightens me), Mr. X (he cross-dresses, and I can&#8217;t remember whether I should refer to him as he or she), unwed mothers who continue to have child after child after child, &#8220;aristocrats&#8221; who think I should show them preferential treatment and stop whatever I&#8217;m doing to take care of their needs immediately.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PULLING IT TOGETHER</h3>
<p class="noindent">To summarize, here is a nonimmediate dialogue, followed by a more immediate dialogue, between a pharmacist and patient. The focus is on the pharmacist&#8217;s verbal immediacy.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Nonimmediate Language</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: What can we do for you today, Mrs. Edwards?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I can&#8217;t believe the doctor put me on insulin injections for my diabetes.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_190"/>Pharmacist: Well, you know, <em>a lot of patients with diabetes</em> take insulin injections.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: But I hate needles.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: <em>Most patients with diabetes</em> say they don&#8217;t give them a second thought once they get used to them.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, (sigh) I don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Don&#8217;t worry. <em>Everyone</em> who takes shots does just fine eventually. You&#8217;ll do just fine.</p>
<p class="indentt">This dialogue is a prime example of nonimmediacy. The whole tone of this interaction is one of nonidentity and detachment. First, the pharmacist distances himself from the patient&#8217;s problem. He does not address Mrs. Edwards&#8217;s concerns. Not once during the interaction does the pharmacist appear to identify with the patient&#8217;s emotional state. Second, the pharmacist does not deal with the patient on a personal level. Notice how the pharmacist talks about other patients instead of Mrs. Edwards as an individual.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Immediate Language</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Hi, Mrs. Edwards. What can I do for you today?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I can&#8217;t believe the doctor put me on insulin injections for my diabetes.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I see (looking at the prescription). You are obviously very concerned about this. Do needles scare you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yes, they do.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Mrs. Edwards, did the doctor show you how to give yourself an injection?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: No.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Well, <em>I&#8217;d</em> like to show you how to safely and properly administer the injections. <em>Soon</em>, you&#8217;ll be doing this like a pro. I think that might help with some of the fear.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, (sigh) I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_191"/>Pharmacist: Mrs. Edwards, <em>I&#8217;ll</em> help you any way <em>I</em> can. <em>If we work together</em>, I know you can do this.</p>
<p class="indentt">This dialogue is an example of immediacy. First, the pharmacist does not distance himself from the patient&#8217;s problem. He addresses Mrs. Edwards&#8217;s concerns. Notice how this pharmacist uses a lot of &#8220;I&#8221; statements in regard to helping the patient. Second, the pharmacist deals with the patient on a personal level. The pharmacist does not make references to other patients, but talks about how Mrs. Edwards sees the problem. Note how much more personal this pharmacist&#8217;s language is.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY OF VERBAL IMMEDIACY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Using more verbally immediate language is one way of building rapport with patients. By using more verbally immediate language, pharmacists begin the process of identifying with their patients and their patients&#8217; problems. Furthermore, using more verbally immediate language can be instrumental in establishing relationships with patients based on a teamwork approach to managing their illnesses.</p>
<h3 class="h3">NONVERBAL IMMEDIACY</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have seen how the words we choose can serve to create either emotional distance or immediacy. Now we will discuss nonverbal communication. Recent literature suggests that nonverbal immediacy behaviors on the part of physicians and other health care providers are very much related to patient satisfaction with care, and hence, outcomes.<sup><a id="ch14-ref4" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT IS NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION?</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nonverbal communication includes the way space or physical distance is used in communication (<em>proxemics</em>), the use of time in our communication (<em>chronemics</em>), the amount of eye contact or gaze (<em>oculesics</em>), the use of touch (<em>haptics</em>), body movement (<em>kinesics</em>), the use and choice of objects in communication, such as clothing or symbols (<em>objectics</em>), and the use and quality of the human voice, such as changes in tone and pitch (<em>vocalics</em>). An estimated 55&#37; of the meaning we derive in the communication process is the direct result of nonverbal messages, approximately 38&#37; comes from vocal cues, and 7&#37; comes from the verbal messages.<sup><a id="ch14-ref5" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref5">5</a></sup> This has very important implications for communicating with patients. We often focus on the words spoken, but 93&#37; of the meaning of the message is derived from nonverbal cues. It is very important <a id="page_192"/>that there is congruence between verbal and nonverbal cues. Let&#8217;s look at each of the nonverbal areas and see how they might affect our communication with patients. The assumption is that we want our communication to be more, rather than less, immediate. That is, we want our communication to cause us to be perceived as warm, caring, and approachable.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PROXEMICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proxemics is concerned with the physical distance between people when they communicate. Different types of communication require different spacing. For example, a person giving a public speech would be expected to stand farther away from the receivers of the message than a health care provider talking with a patient. There are certain distances that fall within a normal range of comfort for the parties communicating. Although there are cultural differences, most people are comfortable with certain distances in certain communication contexts. If, during a patient&#8217;s visit to a physician, the physician entered the examining room, said hello, then sat down at the farthest point across the room from the patient, most patients would probably not find this distance comfortable. It would communicate indifference or discomfort on the part of the physician. On the other hand, if the physician entered the room, said hello, and then sat in a chair where his knees touched the patient&#8217;s knees, this would not be comfortable either. It would be too intimate or immediate. The patient&#8217;s own nonverbal cues (e.g., leaning back, closed arms) would probably indicate this.</p>
<p class="indent">When a pharmacist is discussing health care matters with a patient, it is important that the physical distance between the two reflect the appropriate degree of immediacy. The distance should create some privacy (too far apart would mean your conversation would be audible to others) while at the same time not creating discomfort. Our patients will give us nonverbal cues when we stand too close. In North America, people in intimate or private conversations stand 6 to 18 inches apart.<sup><a id="ch14-ref6" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref6">6</a></sup> This is what is generally comfortable. However, in some cultures, standing closer or farther away may be insulting. Physical distance can communicate the degree of caring or intimacy in a conversation.</p>
<p class="indent">Also, whether we sit or stand while talking to the patient communicates information about acceptance and caring. Sitting communicates that you are not going to rush things and places you in a position that is less intimidating to the patient. This is another reason why pharmacies are lowering their prescription counters to floor level. It promotes better communication.</p>
<p class="indent">The following example shows a pharmacist&#8217;s use of proxemics: A patient who is obviously distressed tries to talk to the pharmacist, who <a id="page_193"/>is behind the counter. The counter presents a barrier to communication, so the pharmacist comes out from behind the counter and motions the patient to an area that is more private. This communicates caring, respect, and understanding to the patient.</p>
<h3 class="h3">CHRONEMICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the United States we are extremely time conscious and are not used to waiting more than 5 minutes.<sup><a href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref6">6</a></sup> With a few exceptions (at nice restaurants, in physicians&#8217; offices), Americans resent waiting for long periods of time. Even a 15-minute wait, which is fairly common in many pharmacies, is viewed with impatience. It is important to convey value in the wait in order to reduce this negative view of waiting. This can be done by providing services worth waiting for (e.g., counseling, disease management), or it can be done by showing compassion and empathy. For example, consider the following scenario:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Fifteen minutes? Just to throw a few pills in a bottle? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding. I just had to wait almost an hour and a half at the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: That is a long time. I will get your medicine to you as quickly as I can. I do have two other patients ahead of you, and I want to be accurate with everyone&#8217;s medicine. I do appreciate your patience.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I&#8217;m just sick of all this waiting. You people must think we have nothing better to do.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know that you have waited a long time today. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and get started so that it doesn&#8217;t take any longer than necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt">Notice in this situation that the pharmacist does not take the patient&#8217;s frustration personally. Notice also that the pharmacist acknowledges the patient&#8217;s complaint but does not take responsibility for the problem or attempt to solve it. The pharmacist is caring and compassionate but not willing to engage the patient in a debate.</p>
<h3 class="h3">OCULESICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Eye contact is very important in communicating understanding and caring. Direct eye contact communicates interest and attention. It helps us to gauge the truthfulness, intelligence, attitudes, and feelings of others. <a id="page_194"/>Our culture values direct eye contact (as long as it is not staring). In fact, we believe that people who won&#8217;t look you directly in the eye are up to no good. There is a great deal of research showing that speakers who refuse to establish eye contact are perceived as ill at ease, insincere, or dishonest. Therefore, it is important to be aware of your own eye contact with patients when communicating with them.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you make a habit of doing other tasks when talking to patients? Do you find yourself looking more at a computer screen or medicine vials than at your patients? Not establishing eye contact while talking to a patient is likely to be distracting and communicates disinterest. Make it a point to establish good eye contact with your clients when talking to them. Also, keep in mind the patient&#8217;s response to your eye contact. For example, by maintaining eye contact with the patient you are more likely to pick up nonverbal cues regarding whether the patient understands you. Many patients will say they understand when they truly don&#8217;t, but patients&#8217; facial expressions, such as a raised eyebrow, often reveal confusion, misunderstanding, or uncertainty. These important cues can be missed by pharmacists who do not take the time to maintain eye contact. Although it is generally true that direct eye contact may have negative consequences in negative or threatening situations, and lack of eye contact often communicates indifference or inattention, the amount of eye contact should depend on the patient&#8217;s response. If the patient reacts uncomfortably to your direct eye contact, looking away occasionally may be a good idea.</p>
<h3 class="h3">HAPTICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Touch can be extremely important in communicating caring to a patient. Touch has generally been found to reduce tension, affect rapport, and enhance the therapeutic abilities of the health professional.<sup><a id="ch14-ref7" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref7">7</a></sup> The use of touch is very much dependent on the emotional context, the relationship between the patient and the pharmacist, and how comfortable the pharmacist and patient are about the use of touch. Anglo-Americans tend to use touch less often than Italian-Americans and Afro-Americans.<sup><a href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref6">6</a></sup> Therefore, touch may be interpreted very differently among these groups. Although different groups tend to use more touch, there are few cultural standards for touch. Therefore, touch needs to be used with caution.</p>
<p class="indent">According to some studies, touch by a health care professional can be interpreted as superficial or demeaning if it is used too often during a conversation or an encounter. This could be true when touch is used as a substitute for verbally expressing true caring and understanding or when touch is used to diminish the importance of a problem without appropriate expression in words. For example, if a patient is discussing <a id="page_195"/>the amount of pain he is experiencing from his arthritis and the physician pats him on the back, this type of touch may be interpreted as placating but not caring. The same touch with the words &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can&#8217;t get you some medicine that will help with this pain&#8221; would be interpreted quite differently. In addition, when touch is used with a new patient, it is often misinterpreted or viewed with caution.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, touch should not be used if the patient or health care provider is uncomfortable with it. The health care provider should be especially sensitive to the verbal and nonverbal cues of the patient. Posture that pulls away or a startled look is a good indication that this is not comfortable for the patient. If you are not comfortable being touched or touching others, it is best to not force a touch. Sincere words will do just as well. Touching is viewed as a rather intimate gesture in our culture and, as such, should be used carefully and cautiously.</p>
<h3 class="h3">KINESICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Kinesics concerns itself with body movement in communication. This includes movement of the head, arms, legs, eyes, and so on. Body movement can have a profound impact on the way a message is communicated and interpreted. If I look at you and say &#8220;way to go&#8221; but my head is shaking &#8220;no,&#8221; no is the message you will likely believe. The message will be interpreted as sarcasm. It is vitally important that both nonverbal body movements and tone of voice (vocalics&#8212;more on this later) match the verbal message. Congruence is essential. Haase and Tepper<sup><a id="ch14-ref8" href="chapter14.xhtml#ch14_ref8">8</a></sup> found that, especially in counseling situations, highly empathic messages are undermined by inconsistent or incongruent nonverbal messages, including body movements (looking away, being distracted), voice tone (flat affect, indifference), or body position (standing, back to person).</p>
<p class="indent">It should be noted that kinesics is very much tied to cultural norms. The gesture of pointing to someone to indicate that his or her prescription is ready is perfectly normal in our culture. That same gesture is indicated only for calling dogs in some African countries. Extending a hand to introduce yourself to a patient is perfectly normal in our culture. Done with the wrong hand, it may be considered an insult in some Middle Eastern cultures (the &#8220;wrong&#8221; hand is used only for wiping oneself after defecating). So, although some gestures are the same across many cultures, different cultures can give very different meanings to the same gestures.</p>
<p class="indent">Being aware of your own gestures and body movements is very important. It can help you to congruently communicate the intended meaning of your verbal statements.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_196"/>OBJECTICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">This refers to both the use and choice of objects in communication. One very important object is the clothing we choose to wear. It can communicate a great deal about us. Are the clothes in style? Are they ironed or wrinkled? Do the colors go together? How does the pharmacist distinguish himself or herself from the rest of the staff in the pharmacy? Does the pharmacist wear a professional coat that is a different color and has an identifying name badge or symbol indicating that he or she is a pharmacist? It is important for patients to understand to whom they are talking so that they don&#8217;t waste time and effort and feel embarrassed if they tell ancillary personnel information that was intended only for a health professional. Clothes certainly can communicate expertise to the patient by way of specific identifiers.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to clothing, other objects communicate different messages. Is there an area in the pharmacy where patients can sit and wait? If so, this communicates sensitivity to the clients. Are the chairs comfortable? Is the waiting area clean? Are there reading materials in the waiting area? Are they health related, or is there a variety of both health-related and non-health-related materials? Are there popular magazines to read? Are they out-of-date? All of these things communicate different things to patients. Are the objects surrounding your pharmacy communicating the message you want to communicate? Many pharmacies sell items that are not health related. These may include cigarettes, cosmetics, greeting cards, household items (e.g., paper towels, toilet paper, glass cleaners), and candy. Does selling these items confuse the patient about what our primary intent is as a health care provider? Is selling these items consistent with the health image you are trying to convey? Quite frankly, why would any health care provider sell items such as cigarettes and tobacco, which are clearly deleterious to health? Profit simply does not justify the sale of these items in a pharmacy. This is a primary example of how important objectics can be in communicating an image. In moving toward pharmaceutical care, pharmacies may need to reconsider the items they sell and the effects of those items on the image conveyed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">VOCALICS</h3>
<p class="noindent">This involves the use of the human voice in communication. It involves both tone and pitch. Think about this sentence: &#8220;I really like it when you come in on time for your medicine.&#8221; That same sentence can be said very differently, depending on pitch, tone, and emphasis. Said blandly, the statement may not have much impact. Said with enthusiasm and emphasis on certain words, the meaning changes: &#8220;I <em>really like <a id="page_197"/>it</em> when you come in on time for you medicine!&#8221; This is encouraging. However, if this same sentence is said sarcastically to a patient who is 7 days late in getting his medicine, the meaning changes again: &#8220;I <em>really</em> like it when you come in on time.&#8221; This, said with a look of disapproval, would be belittling to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The human voice communicates much to the receiver. This is especially true when communication takes place over the telephone. Research indicates that personality is inferred through the sound of the voice. Often the interpretation is inaccurate because of preconceived ideas we have about different types of voices. We may think of someone with a deep voice as being wise or large, for example. What this should tell us is that we need to be sure that the meaning we intend is communicated clearly, especially when talking on the telephone.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PULLING IT TOGETHER</h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Scenario:</strong> Mrs. Monroe is obviously distressed. She has just learned that she has skin cancer.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Proxemics:</strong> The pharmacist steps from behind the counter and motions Mrs. Monroe to a more private area. Mrs. Monroe indicates that the physician was confusing when she talked about the possible side effects of the medication.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Oculesics:</strong> The pharmacist goes over the possible side effects and explains what Mrs. Monroe should do if they occur. The pharmacist observes that Mrs. Monroe looks confused. So, he stops and asks her if she understands. She says she does. Even though she replies that she understands, he provides a more thorough, detailed explanation. After this explanation, Mrs. Monroe&#8217;s facial expressions indicate that she understands.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Kinesics:</strong> The pharmacist makes sure that his body movements and facial expressions are congruent with his words. That is, when he says he is concerned, he looks concerned.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Vocalics:</strong> During the conversation, the pharmacist varies his tone, rate, and volume. For example, the pharmacist noticed that Mrs. Monroe tended to whisper the word <em>cancer</em>. Therefore, he also lowered his voice whenever he used the word. The pharmacist used a soft, calm, and even tone throughout the conversation as a means of comfort.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Haptics:</strong> At one point during the conversation, the pharmacist placed his hand on Mrs. Monroe&#8217;s hand, looked into her eyes, and said in a sincere tone, &#8220;I want to help you through this.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_198"/>SUMMARY OF NONVERBAL IMMEDIACY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nonverbal communication is an important factor in conveying the meaning in a message. Verbal and nonverbal messages need to be congruent, since the nonverbal message is the one that is generally believed. It is not enough to accurately perceive a patient&#8217;s feelings and to communicate that understanding verbally. Physical distance, posture, objects in the environment, voice tone, and gestures can all change the meaning of the message. The most effective counselors are the ones whose nonverbal messages are congruent with their verbal messages.</p>
