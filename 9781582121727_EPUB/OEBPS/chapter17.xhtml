<h2 class="h2a"><em>COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENTS WHO HAVE<br/>LITERACY<br/>LIMITATIONS</em></h2>
<p class="chapauthor">Jan Kavookjian</p>
<p class="noindent">Most pharmacists at some point in their career will encounter a patient with limited literacy. Such patients are among those who can benefit most from interacting with a pharmacist to learn about their health conditions and their medications</p>
<p class="indent">Like other health care providers, pharmacists are trained to communicate in highly technical language. Among their peers, they are rewarded socially and professionally for the ability to communicate on this level. Pharmacy students and residents are under pressure to memorize and recount drug names and structures and pharmacokinetic and therapeutic mechanisms, and they come to view the ability to communicate in these terms as a measure of their success. Unfortunately, the use of such high-level scientific language often extends to the patient education pages of health-related journals. A recent study evaluated the reading level of patient education materials in 10 such journals; in only 2 of the journals did those materials fall within the recommended 5th- to 6th-grade level.<sup><a id="ch17-ref1" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">A few years ago, a colleague and I conducted a study to assess the level of communication in a writing assignment by second-year pharmacy students.<sup><a id="ch17-ref2" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref2">2</a></sup> The students were asked to prepare a brief monograph, based on drug- or health-related literature, that answered a typical health question. They were then to test the grade level of their writing by using the reading statistics function of word processing software. The stated objective was to write the response to the question at a 4thto 5th-grade reading level, which is the average level for patients covered by Medicaid. But the average level of the students&#8217; initial monographs was 11th grade, and it took an average of 4.67 revisions to bring <a id="page_230"/>the wording down to the target level. Most students were unaware that they had been communicating at such a high level and were surprised at the effort it took to achieve the target. Simple revisions such as changing &#8220;monitoring your blood glucose&#8221; to &#8220;checking your blood sugar&#8221; made a significant difference in reducing the reading level.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem of limitations in both general literacy and health literacy has received much attention in recent years. Patients with either type of limitation present challenges for pharmacists. The pharmacist must be alert to signs of literacy problems and then decide how to tactfully and caringly approach the subject with the patient. In this chapter we will explore (1) the implications of deficiencies in both basic literacy and health literacy, (2) sensitive ways of detecting and addressing patients&#8217; literacy limitations, and (3) communication strategies the pharmacist can use with these patients. A list of relevant resources for patients and health care professionals is provided at the end of the chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3">DEFINING AND DESCRIBING LITERACY</h3>
<p class="noindent">The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL)<sup><a id="ch17-ref3" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref3">3</a></sup> has been a substantial force in studying literacy problems in the United States and supporting initiatives to address them. One important initiative of that organization was the National Literacy Act, which defined literacy in this country as &#8220;an individual&#8217;s ability to read, write, and speak in English, compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, to achieve one&#8217;s goals, and develop one&#8217;s knowledge and potential.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, functional literacy was thought to be based on the amount of education achieved, as expressed in grade-level equivalents. In recent years, particularly on the basis of the National Adult Literacy Survey in the 1990s and the National Assessment of Adult Literacy in 2003, it has been suggested that grade level may not be a good measure of reading comprehension.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref3">3</a>,<a id="ch17-ref4" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref4">4</a></sup> Four operational levels of literacy have been proposed: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient.<sup><a id="ch17-ref5" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref5">5</a></sup> Nevertheless, the grade level designation is still in common use. The average reading level among all Americans, referred to as the functional reading level in the United States, is 8th grade. To put this in perspective, this chapter, according to the Flesch-Kincaid statistics function in Microsoft Word, is at the 11th-grade level.</p>
<p class="indent">The National Adult Literacy Survey estimated that nearly 90 million U.S. adults had some form of illiteracy. Degrees of illiteracy were defined in the late 1990s. Persons who are completely unable to read or write are considered illiterate. Those who read at or below the 5th-grade level are considered functionally illiterate. Those who can read at the 5th- to 8th-grade level are said to have marginal literacy, and those <a id="page_231"/>who are able to read, write, and understand at the 5th- to 8th-grade level are considered to have low literacy.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">An estimated 42&#37; of Americans are functionally illiterate and unable to read the front page of a newspaper. More than 20&#37; of U.S. adults read at lower than a 5th-grade level. For Medicaid patients, the average reading level is 5th grade or lower. Illiteracy is twice as prevalent among older Americans and inner-city minority Americans as in other segments of the population.<sup>4,6</sup> It is important for practicing pharmacists to watch for signs of literacy limitations in their patients, particularly patients in segments of the population that have been identified as at risk for literacy problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3">HOW LIMITED LITERACY AFFECTS HEALTH AND OUTCOMES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Several researchers have examined the impact of literacy limitations on patient outcomes. The findings are alarming and costly for both the patient and the health care system. Patients with low literacy are not only more likely to have low health knowledge but also more likely to have higher rates of chronic disease and hospitalization and limited use of preventive health services.</p>
<p class="indent">Results from a study of 2659 low-income outpatients at the clinics of two public hospitals suggested that 26&#37; could not read their appointment slips, 47&#37; could not understand written directions to take their medication without food, 60&#37; did not understand a consent form, and 21&#37; could not understand instructions written at the 4th-grade reading level.<sup><a id="ch17-ref7" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref7">7</a></sup> It is also known that adults with low literacy may have difficulty accurately reading prescription labels; are less likely to have a Pap smear or blood pressure check; tend to smoke more, drink more coffee, exercise less, and get hurt on the job more frequently; tend to make less-informed decisions regarding treatment options; tend to incur higher health care costs; and often do not know where to begin in communicating with providers, which impairs the process of making effective diagnosis and treatment decisions.<sup><a id="ch17-ref8" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Patients with literacy limitations have particular difficulty managing complicated chronic illnesses such as HIV infection and diabetes. This is particularly problematic with HIV, because resistance to antiretroviral medications is likely to develop when the patient does not adhere to the drug regimen. The highly active antiretroviral therapies, which have significantly improved the length and quality of life for HIV-positive patients, consist of a complicated &#8220;cocktail&#8221; regimen that requires near-perfect adherence in order to be effective. With diabetes, large longitudinal studies (e.g., the Diabetes Control and Complications <a id="page_232"/>Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) have shown that intensive control of blood glucose significantly lowers the risk of serious complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Intensive glycemic control entails careful daily attention to complex self-care behaviors: taking oral medication, injecting oneself with insulin, or both; monitoring with a blood glucose meter; following dietary restrictions, which requires the ability to read food labels; and exercising regularly. It is clear that patients with literacy limitations are at a disadvantage in managing HIV, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses, and thus are at greater risk for tragic, preventable outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">According to a recent study,<sup><a id="ch17-ref9" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref9">9</a></sup> only about 10&#37; of pharmacies proactively try to identify patient literacy limitations. This suggests that pharmacy is missing a strategic opportunity to intervene with patients who most need education and for whom the improvement in outcomes could be great. Accessible pharmacists who see these patients regularly for refills of maintenance medications are in a position to have a significant impact. This can be accomplished one patient at a time, through being watchful for signs of literacy limitations and being prepared with sensitive ways of communicating with patients who exhibit them.</p>
<h3 class="h3">IDENTIFYING PATIENTS WITH LITERACY LIMITATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Weiss and colleagues<sup><a id="ch17-ref10" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref10">10</a></sup> at the University of Arizona have suggested that in primary care, assessment of literacy should be &#8220;the new vital sign&#8221; checked at patient intake. They recommend using a standardized, validated instrument to detect literacy limitations. In pharmacy practice, this would not be practical in some settings. However, it might be practical in a clinic or academic pharmacy setting, or when a community pharmacy is enrolling patients in a disease management service (e.g., for diabetes or asthma management).</p>
<p class="indent">Several validated measures of literacy and health literacy are available. Weiss&#8217;s group developed an instrument called Newest Vital Sign. Other tools that have been validated and are more widely used include the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, the short version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, and the Wide Range Achievement Test.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes patients are open about their literacy limitations; they may overtly tell the provider or ask for help. Other patients may be indirect or may use subtle cues. For example, a patient may make excuses for not reading a form that he or she has been given (e.g., &#8220;I left my glasses at home&#8221;), may take an unusually long time attempting to read material provided, or may state that the relative or caregiver at home <a id="page_233"/>is the person who handles these things. One pharmacist says that he watches how patients react when handed written material. If a patient stares at one area of the handout for a long time, without moving it as a literate patient would naturally do out of curiosity or as reading progresses, the pharmacist sees this as a possible sign of limitations the patient is trying to hide. Another pharmacist, who practices in an indigent care clinic where literacy limitations are prevalent, hands the patient an information sheet upside down and watches to see if the patient turns it right side up when looking at it.</p>
<p class="indent">Another pharmacist said that when a patient brings someone along with him or her, this is a cue to assess literacy limitations in both the patient and the caregiver. This pharmacist also reported that when she holds a &#8220;brown bag&#8221; medicine review, she starts by asking patients what their medications and doses are and for what conditions they are taking them. If a patient has difficulty with the response but does not read the label and instead opens the container to look at the medication, this may be a sign of literacy limitation.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, patients&#8217; use of folk terms (e.g., &#8220;in the family way&#8221; instead of pregnant, or &#8220;a touch of sugar&#8221; for diabetes) in talking with their health care providers may indicate limited proficiency with the written or spoken language. If a patient speaks to the pharmacist in broken English, whether with a native or a nonnative accent, this should be considered reason to probe further for literacy limitations.</p>
<p class="indent">It is probable that most patients avoid letting their pharmacist and other health care providers know about their literacy limitations. We have all heard the saying &#8220;knowledge is power.&#8221; The opposite is also true: lack of knowledge is powerlessness. When adults with low literacy avoid admitting their limitation or asking for help, they may be acting out of desire to avoid facing the powerlessness and vulnerability that go along with it. They do not want to face the shame and embarrassment this limitation creates for them.<sup><a id="ch17-ref11" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref11">11</a></sup> Most likely, they have had lifelong experience being judged for their literacy limitations, and they may be reluctant to reveal their vulnerability to a new person. The moment a pharmacist realizes the patient may have literacy limitations, he or she should carefully employ communication skills discussed in previous chapters of this book, such as listening, empathy, and assertiveness, to assess the limitations and help the patient find the most comfortable way of receiving necessary information.</p>
<p class="indent">Other direct and conversational approaches to detecting literacy limitations may be taken. In some clinic settings, patients could be asked to write a reflection on how they feel about a topic related to their condition. Or, the patient could be asked to tell the pharmacist what instructions the physician gave. The patient could also be asked what <a id="page_234"/>the labels on a prescription vial mean to him or her; for example, &#8220;Some of these labels may be confusing; what does this label mean to you?&#8221;<sup><a id="ch17-ref12" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref12">12</a></sup> Another strategy is to ask patients directly if they will need help reading or understanding the written material they are given.</p>
<h3 class="h3">HOW THE PHARMACIST CAN HELP</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacists need to be aware that some patients with literacy problems will resist help. Their pride may make them unwilling to face their limitation. As with any resistant patient, important first strategies are an immediate empathic response and exploration of the resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who depend on a caregiver or family member exhibit what is known as &#8220;learned helplessness.&#8221; They are more comfortable taking a passive role and letting another person manage their health information and treatment decisions. Although this may not be ideal, it may be the only viable option for ensuring that a patient with a literacy barrier receives the needed information. With such a patient, a direct and assertive request to follow up with the caregiver or family member is warranted, particularly when the patient has a high-risk condition or takes a medication with a narrow therapeutic range. The following dialogue provides an example.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mr. Jones, please tell me what you know from the handout we gave you about what foods you should avoid while you are taking this medication that keeps your blood from clumping together.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I really don&#8217;t take care of all that stuff, don&#8217;t like to fool with it. My daughter lives with me and cooks my meals and organizes my pills. She does the grocery shopping, too. I&#8217;ll give her the handout and let her take care of it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Mr. Jones, it sounds like you&#8217;re very comfortable with your daughter helping you to manage your condition. That&#8217;s wonderful that she is willing to do that. The information on the handout about the foods is a very important part of doing that. I would like to talk with your daughter to make sure she has the information she needs to help you. What are your thoughts about that?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yeah, that would be okay. She plans and cooks at our house, so she should get that handout and talk to you about it.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_235"/>The pharmacist starts by probing for understanding of written material about foods that could hinder the patient&#8217;s anticoagulation therapy. This patient seems resistant to learning the information on his own and defers to his caregiver. Rather than getting drawn into the resistance, the pharmacist rolls with it and does not argue; instead, the pharmacist first reflects back the patient&#8217;s comfort with his caregiver. He then remains assertive about the importance of the information and uses an &#8220;I&#8221; statement, in a matter-of-fact and nonjudgmental tone, to make the point that he wants to give the important information to the daughter. The &#8220;I&#8221; statement exhibits confidence and sincerity; this reinforces the importance of the information. If the pharmacist had been indirect, the patient might have doubted the importance of getting the information. The pharmacist ends with an open-ended question, which is meant to tell the patient he is respected and in control of this decision to have his caregiver contacted by the pharmacist.</p>
<p class="indent">The communication skills of listening and empathy are the foundation of building a therapeutic alliance with any patient. They are especially important for helping to preserve self-esteem or &#8220;face&#8221; for a patient with literacy limitations during the provision of health care and related information. Some pharmacists may need to make a conscious decision to remain in a nonjudgmental mode of being and communicating with the patient. It is also important to remain assertive, confident, and matter-of-fact. Being assertive can feel confrontational and uncomfortable for some, but awareness and practice of assertiveness skills (see <a href="chapter7.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a>) can help the pharmacist overcome his or her discomfort and gain confidence.</p>
<p class="indent">When a health care provider begins, because of his or her own anxiety, to feel discomfort about an interaction, he or she may tend to react by beating around the bush, being indirect, and using avoidant verbal and nonverbal signals to &#8220;soften&#8221; the tone of the interaction. This makes the provider&#8217;s discomfort and anxiety readily evident to the other person. Furthermore, being indirect can be perceived as insincere. It creates dissonance and can erode trust. Persons who communicate directly and assertively convey&#8212;through their nonverbal cues and tone&#8212;honesty, caring, and a confidence that can be trusted. These points are illustrated by the pharmacist&#8217;s inappropriate and appropriate responses in the following dialogues. In this scenario, the pharmacist notices that the patient has been staring blankly at the disease management handout he just gave her.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_236"/>Dialogue 1</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Ma&#8217;am is there anything I can help you with? I mean&#8230;I wanted to give you that so you can take it with you, but if you need something else, I can do that too&#8230;uh, just tell me what you need.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: What do you mean? What else can you give me? They wouldn&#8217;t let me have an early refill of that oxy drug&#8230;Can you do that for me?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: No, I mean the information handout I gave you. It looks like maybe you&#8217;re having sort of a hard time reading it, so I thought you might kind of&#8230;uh&#8230;want somebody to read it to you? (with questioning inflection)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient (after a long pause): I&#8217;ll just take it with me; I don&#8217;t have time to think about it right now.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: But, I need to make sure you get the information and understand it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I&#8217;m fine. (walks away)</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The pharmacist is trying to circumvent addressing the patient&#8217;s literacy limitations. This places the burden of disclosure on the patient, making the situation more uncomfortable than it needs to be. The patient misunderstands the pharmacist&#8217;s intentions and is then likely embarrassed not only about misunderstanding but also about the realization that the pharmacist is uncomfortable with her literacy limitations. The pharmacist argues with her that he &#8220;needs&#8221; to give her the information. The pharmacist&#8217;s first mistake is the indirect way in which he approaches the patient; he reveals his own discomfort by using filler words (&#8220;kind of,&#8221; &#8220;sort of,&#8221; &#8220;uh&#8221;) and a nonassertive, questioning inflection at the end of his statement. When the patient becomes resistant, he argues with her rather than rolling with it and focusing on her needs&#8212;his second inappropriate response. Third, he misses an opportunity for an empathic response that might have repaired the rift in trust and connection. After the patient says that she will &#8220;just take it&#8221; and does not have time, he could have responded, &#8220;Mrs. Smith, it seems like you are in a hurry, and perhaps I offended you by the way I approached this. I surely don&#8217;t want to do that. I&#8217;d like to start over. May I talk with you <a id="page_237"/>for a few minutes to be sure you understand what you need to know about this medication?&#8221;</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Mrs. Smith, I&#8217;d like to be sure we&#8217;ve given you all the information you need to manage your medication when you get home. What is your understanding about the information I&#8217;ve just given you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, I&#8217;m not sure. Which parts are you talking about? The front or the back?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It sounds like maybe I&#8217;ve confused you. Can we take a few minutes and sit over here? I&#8217;d like to go over it with you section by section so I can point out the important parts and explain anything we might have confused you about.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Yeah, that would be good. That way I&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s most important.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The pharmacist is direct and caring. His initial question probing for understanding is assertive. It accomplishes an assessment of literacy, and it also places the burden for understanding on the pharmacist rather than the patient&#8212;which avoids embarrassing the patient. The patient&#8217;s response is a cover for the literacy limitation. A patient&#8217;s focus on a broad issue (such as whether the pharmacist means the front or the back of the page) rather than on the medical information is a red flag that the patient has limited ability either to read or to understand the printed material.</p>
<p class="indent">This pharmacist gives an appropriate empathic response; he not only tries to help the patient feel understood but also places the burden of understanding on himself and shields the patient from having to reveal her vulnerability. The pharmacist also shows respect for the patient by offering to have the conversation in a more private area. This demonstrates empathy; it considers that the patient may feel embarrassed about her literacy limitation. In addition, the pharmacist&#8217;s use of an open-ended question about her understanding makes the conversation feel less like an inquisition. His request for permission to give information then shows respect for the patient&#8217;s right to choose to receive the information; this supports her autonomy. Patients who are feeling powerless, as patients with literacy limitations may, need to have their <a id="page_238"/>autonomy supported; this helps build trust in the relationship. The intent is to make the patient feel safe. At some future point in the relationship, it may be safe to broach the subject of literacy directly and to offer helpful tools or resources, or even discuss educational opportunities. The initial encounter may or may not be the ideal time to approach such subjects with a new patient.</p>
<h3 class="h3">IMPLICATIONS OF LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the past 10 to 15 years, it has become recognized that low health literacy&#8212;separate from written- or spoken-word literacy limitations&#8212;has a substantial negative impact on a person&#8217;s health. New emphasis has been placed on addressing health literacy limitations. In 2004, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Medical Association all released reports of studies on health literacy. These reports concurred that large segments of the U.S. population do not have the health literacy skills needed to function for optimal outcomes in the current health care system.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref8">8</a>,<a id="ch17-ref13" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref13">13</a></sup> Processing and using health information requires cognitive and social skills that many patients may not have. According to these three reports, up to one-half of all U.S. adults may lack the skills necessary to function optimally in a health care environment, such as being able to give the correct dose of cold medicine to a child or being able to interpret informed consent documents. Furthermore, the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy suggested that only 12&#37; of U.S. adults have a health literacy level of proficient and that 15&#37; (30 million adults) have below basic health literacy.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref14">14</a>,<a id="ch17-ref15" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Health literacy is defined in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative as &#8220;the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.&#8221; A patient may be able to read, write, and speak the English language yet lack the cognitive or social skills necessary to process the meaning in an interaction with a health care provider. Lower health literacy has been shown to result in more hospitalizations, higher health care costs, poorer health status, less understanding about how to manage illness and medications, less use of preventive health services, and significantly poorer self-management in diabetes, HIV, and asthma.<sup><a id="ch17-ref6" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref6">6</a>,<a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref14">14</a>,<a id="ch17-ref16" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref16">16</a></sup>&#8211;<a id="ch17-ref18" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref18">18</a> Limitations in health literacy affect a patient&#8217;s ability to</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Navigate the health care system, locate providers and services, fill out forms, and negotiate with insurance companies for covered services or claims,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><a id="page_239"/><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Share health history and other personal information with providers,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Engage in the requisite behaviors for self-management of disease, and</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Understand concepts such as probability and risk, mathematical calculations (e.g., of cholesterol and blood glucose levels), measuring medications, and evaluating nutrition labels on food packages.</p>
<p class="indentt">Education alone cannot adequately motivate patients to maintain self-care behaviors, but knowing about one&#8217;s illness and its treatment is certainly the first step. For patients with health literacy limitations, pharmacists are in a unique position to bridge the gap between receipt of care and daily self-management of the patient&#8217;s disease or condition.</p>
<h3 class="h3">ADDRESSING HEALTH LITERACY LIMITATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacists can use the &#8220;teach-back&#8221; method to check for a patient&#8217;s understanding. Here is how it works. To ensure that the message was heard and correctly interpreted, the patient is asked to restate in his or her own words what the pharmacist has said. This repetition also reinforces the patient&#8217;s learning. When the patient&#8217;s understanding is inaccurate or incomplete, the pharmacist should gently repeat the information until the patient is able to restate it correctly.<sup><a id="ch17-ref14" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Tips for using the teach-back method are as follows:</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Summarize in simple, plain language what the patient needs to do.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Use a handout or a written brochure, preferably one with illustrations or graphics.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Explain what each medication is for (including dosing, side effects, and expectations).</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Ensure that the patient knows where the written instructions are in the handout.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Check for understanding.</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist may begin to check for understanding as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;I want to be sure I didn&#8217;t leave out anything that I should have told you. Would you please repeat back to me what you are to do, so I can be sure I was clear about the important points?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_240"/>This statement is nonjudgmental and face-saving, in that it puts the responsibility for learning on the pharmacist not the patient, and it does not draw attention to literacy or health literacy limitations. It allows patients to get the information they need without causing them discomfort about their limitations. This approach is useful when it is uncertain whether a patient has literacy limitations, particularly with new patients with whom a trusting relationship has yet to be established.</p>
<p class="indent">In a setting that allows pharmacists enough time to interview patients, using a series of open-ended questions can help assess the patient&#8217;s level of understanding of his or her illness and its treatment. For example, the pharmacist might probe into a patient&#8217;s health literacy as follows:</p>
<p class="indentnumbert">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;Tell me, in your own words, what does having this illness mean to you?</p>
<p class="indentnumber">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;What is your understanding of what this illness is?</p>
<p class="indentnumber">3.&#160;&#160;&#160;What is your understanding of what can happen if it is left untreated?</p>
<p class="indentnumber">4.&#160;&#160;&#160;Tell me in your own words what purpose your medication serves in treating this illness.</p>
<p class="indentnumber">5.&#160;&#160;&#160;What other things did your doctor tell you to do that could help treat this illness?</p>
<p class="indentt">Each answer by the patient should be followed by affirmation and then by a request for permission to give additional information if you need to fill in gaps in understanding. For example:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8220;Mrs. Brown, that&#8217;s right; it&#8217;s good that you know untreated diabetes puts you at risk for having problems seeing. May I share with you some additional information about the health risks that could occur if diabetes goes untreated?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt">Since health literacy limitations are so prevalent in the United States, it is likely that pharmacists will encounter patients who are intelligent and even highly educated but are limited in their knowledge of health-related issues. In order to avoid violating the patient&#8217;s &#8220;competence face&#8221; (described in <a href="chapter16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>), the pharmacist should use listening, empathy, open-ended questions, and assertiveness in assessing limitations and giving information. Consider the following dialogues, which take place when a new patient has a new prescription for an anti-seizure medication filled.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_241"/>Dialogue 1</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: Ms. Cooper, here is your prescription. Do you know how to take it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: That&#8217;s <em>Doctor</em> Cooper! I&#8217;m a professor at the university in the mechanical engineering department, and even though I&#8217;ve never taken a drug for any chronic condition, I&#8217;m sure I can figure out how to swallow a pill.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Uh, okay. Well, Dr. Cooper, do you also know that your test results must have been abnormal, since your doctor prescribed this drug? I can&#8217;t tell you enough how important it is that you take this medication exactly as prescribed&#8212;or you may have a major seizure. Can you sit over there and read the package insert and then come back up to the counter and tell me what you understand about it so I can fill in the blanks for you?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I don&#8217;t have time. I can figure it out myself. I need to go.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The patient is clearly offended and defensive; an optimal response would include an apology and an empathic response before moving to the topic at hand. When the patient asserts her status, it is obvious that she is educated and proud of it; she also mentions that this is the first medication she has ever taken for a chronic condition. This pharmacist asks an inquisition-style, closed-ended question, &#8220;Do you know how to take it?&#8221; The response is either yes or no. If the true answer is no, then the patient may respond dishonestly to save face, or she may become defensive to feel less violated. This pharmacist then responds in a lecturing mode and is very condescending. The patient likely feels demeaned, and she leaves the pharmacy without getting the needed information and answers to her questions. Also, this encounter puts the burden of understanding on the patient. Let&#8217;s look at a more appropriate way to handle the encounter.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Pharmacist: I want to be sure we covered all the information that you&#8217;ll need about this medication. What has the doctor or nurse told you about this medication, what it&#8217;s for, and how to take it?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_242"/>Patient: I think I was so shocked to hear that the test results were abnormal that I probably didn&#8217;t hear much of anything else. I&#8217;ve never had to take any drugs for any chronic conditions before, and I feel fine. They think I&#8217;m having seizures of some kind, and the doctor told me I had to take this to avoid having major seizures that would interfere with my work and driving. I&#8217;m a professor at the university, and I have a lot of responsibility. I can&#8217;t afford to have my health problems interfere with that.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It must be very unsettling and scary to get that kind of news. You sound worried about how this will affect your life. May I share with you some information about how taking this drug may give you some peace of mind and control over the uncertainty of seizures?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: OK, yes. That would help.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The pharmacist, knowing very little about this patient, probes for understanding using an open-ended, nonjudgmental question. The patient&#8217;s response reveals several things about her. She is shocked; she is afraid of the uncertainty; she is afraid of how this will affect her ability to stay on top of her career. Also, she has never had to take medication for a chronic condition before, and she feels fine. The fact that she makes several statements suggests that she is trying to figure it out and is looking for support. She says several things that place her feelings out in the open, indicating that she is looking for a response, comfort, or understanding. Clearly, the pharmacist&#8217;s first response should be an empathic one.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#8217;s response tells us that she is bright yet has limited experience with illnesses and medications. The pharmacist asks permission to give her information about the medication and how it may help her with her other concerns. This supports and respects her autonomy and does not violate her competence face. The pharmacist avoids a directive, advising mode that could create more resistance and defensiveness. The offer of information and assistance is supportive and may help the patient see the pharmacist as a resource or collaborator in her health care decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WAYS TO BE SENSITIVE TO LITERACY LIMITATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacy practice settings can adopt some general strategies for making potential encounters with patients who have literacy limitations <a id="page_243"/>more sensitive, caring, and respectful. This is particularly important in settings known to serve patients at risk for low literacy (e.g., Medicaid patients, inner-city minority patients, and older Americans). The first strategy is for the pharmacy practice setting to adopt a culture of sensitivity to literacy limitations. This involves training all staff in the principles of clear communication. Pharmacy staff may need awareness training to avoid using medical terms (e.g., &#8220;anticoagulant,&#8221; &#8220;oral hypoglycemic,&#8221; &#8220;lipids&#8221;) and acronyms that save time for the staff but are not part of a patient&#8217;s vocabulary (e.g., &#8220;OTC,&#8221; &#8220;prn,&#8221; &#8220;HDL,&#8221; &#8220;CMS&#8221;). The staff may need training in using &#8220;plain language&#8221;&#8212;simple, everyday words&#8212;and expressing technical information in simple words (e.g., &#8220;medicine that keeps your blood from clumping together,&#8221; &#8220;medicine that keeps your blood sugar from being high&#8221;).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, it may be useful to revise written materials. Labels and inserts could be revised to use plain language and formatting that presents the most important points first. Such revision also involves breaking complex information into smaller, easier chunks. Furthermore, it is useful to provide materials and signs in the pharmacy in languages commonly spoken by the local population. Signs, in particular, should make it easy to figure out where to go for intake, prescription drop-off, and pickup. Visual guides (e.g., pictures or graphics) can assist as well. Signs and printed materials should have a lot of white space, so the limited reader is not overwhelmed by words.<sup><a id="ch17-ref19" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref19">19</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h3">USEFUL RESOURCES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many tools and resources are available for use in addressing the literacy limitations of patients in health care settings, including pharmacy practices. The Institute of Medicine, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and other organizations are conducting studies of health literacy. Their Web sites provide substantial content and free resources for both health care providers and patients. For example, AHRQ has produced a free tool for analyzing a pharmacy practice setting and the staff&#8217;s skills to determine what changes are needed to improve efficiency and sensitivity in addressing patient literacy limitations.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref19">19</a></sup> AHRQ also funds projects such as PILL: Pharmacy Intervention for Limited Literacy, which uses a &#8220;3 P&#8221; approach to improving medication adherence (i.e., phone reminder, pharmacist trained in literacy-sensitive communication skills, pill card that uses pictures and graphics to organize dosing and scheduling of a patient&#8217;s medications).<sup><a id="ch17-ref20" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref20">20</a></sup> Other studies are exploring the use of visual cues to provide needed information to patients who have literacy limitations.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref8">8</a>,<a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref19">16</a>,<a id="ch17-ref21" href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_244"/>Several companies are developing devices to assist patients with literacy issues, as well as Web-based resources that can be made available to patients in user-friendly kiosks at care sites. Ways of making resources more usable by those with literacy limitations include</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Adding video or audio to text,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Including interactive features,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Using a standardized navigation process throughout segments of the material,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Organizing to minimize the need for searching or scrolling, and</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Making complex information a navigation option for those who want to seek it.<sup><a href="chapter17.xhtml#ch17_ref14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indentt">The National Institute for Literacy provides online forums for professional development, covering topics such as assessment, health literacy, technology, and workplace literacy sensitivity. Many cities and counties have projects for teaching illiterate and low-literate people to read; information on these nonprofit initiatives can be found through local government agencies. <a href="chapter17.xhtml#tab17.1">Table 17-1</a> lists additional resources for understanding patients with health literacy limitations and helping these patients get the assistance they need.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_245"/>SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">The patient with low literacy, illiteracy, or limited health literacy is the person who most needs a pharmacist to serve as a caring advocate. When providing education about diseases and medications, pharmacists should ensure that patients understand why they are taking a medication and what condition is being treated, and that they know how to take the medication correctly. The pharmacist should also explore other health behaviors or aspects of patients&#8217; lifestyle that could be addressed to help manage their medical conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Understanding the implications of literacy limitations for a patient&#8217;s health outcomes, being aware of segments of the population most at risk for literacy limitations, and being vigilant to detect such limitations are keys to making sure that all patients get the advantage of information that can empower them to take better care of their health and improve their quality of life. Pharmacists who use a caring, nonjudgmental approach will communicate to patients support and trust that will help enable them to take charge of their health. Being able to receive and understand health-related information is the first step toward taking charge.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<div class="spc1">
<p class="noindentnumber-box">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;How are literacy skills or limitations related to the use of health care services, costs, and outcomes, and how do they relate to disparities in health outcomes according to race or age?</p>
<p class="noindentnumber-box">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;Why do you think that only 10&#37; of pharmacies are proactively assessing patients for literacy limitations, when pharmacists are in a uniquely accessible position to address patients&#8217; information and health education needs?</p>
<p class="noindentnumber-box">3.&#160;&#160;&#160;Health literacy limitations are significantly more prevalent than basic literacy limitations. This suggests that nearly 90&#37; of your patients will not be proficient when it comes to health literacy. What actions will you take to ensure that your patients understand their medications and illnesses?</p>
<p class="noindentnumber-box">4.&#160;&#160;&#160;Since literacy limitations can be a sensitive topic for patients who have them, why would assertiveness be important in responding to these patients? Might an assertive response feel confrontational to a patient?</p>
<p class="noindentnumber-box">5.&#160;&#160;&#160;At what reading level do you estimate that you communicate with your patients? What are some words and phrases that you can simplify in your own vocabulary to address this?</p>
