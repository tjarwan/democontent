<h2 class="h2a"><em>CHOOSING AN<br/>APPROPRIATE<br/>RESPONSE</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">This chapter summarizes different types of responses to patients and the benefits and downsides of each type. The purpose is to help you choose a response that is the most appropriate for a particular situation in your practice. <a href="chapter12.xhtml#tab12.1">Table 12-1</a> lists each type of response and gives an example of each, along with the benefits and downside of the response.</p>
<p class="indent">Our responses to our patients should be motivated by a willingness to help or care for the patient, not a need to reduce our own anxiety, fear, or frustration because of what a patient says or does. If we are uncomfortable at times, this should be instructive to us, not a stimulus to do whatever we can to escape our discomfort. Our frame of reference should be one of serving the client&#8217;s needs, not our own. From this perspective we can best assess whether our responses are appropriate or inappropriate. Our major focus is helping patients to<sup><a id="ch12-ref1" href="chapter12.xhtml#ch12_ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indentnumbert">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;Feel understood and accepted, thereby allowing them to more freely and openly discuss their problems,</p>
<p class="indentnumber">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;Achieve an increased and more accurate understanding of their situation,</p>
<p class="indentnumber">3.&#160;&#160;&#160;Discuss alternatives, where necessary,</p>
<p class="indentnumber">4.&#160;&#160;&#160;Make decisions about next steps, along with specific actions to be taken, and</p>
<p class="indentnumber">5.&#160;&#160;&#160;Make adjustments so that the best results can be obtained.</p>
<h3 class="h3">EMPATHY</h3>
<p class="noindent">An empathic response is used to convey caring and an accurate understanding of the affective state of another. It is offered objectively, so that the person&#8217;s feelings are accurately reflected back without any judgment about the appropriateness of those feelings. The feelings are simply a reflection of how the other is responding affectively to a situation, which is not good or bad. An empathic response allows people to feel understood and safe in talking about a concern or even something they like or enjoy. The only possible downside to empathy is that your characterization of the person&#8217;s feelings can prompt the person to &#8220;let go&#8221; and feel even more intensely. This can be painful or sometimes frightening, even though it is therapeutic and helps the person move forward. Here are two examples:</p>

<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_160"/><em>Example 1</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: You and my doctor are only interested in getting my money.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You are angry because it seems like your doctor and I care more about your money than about you.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 2</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I just found out I have diabetes. I knew something was wrong.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You knew something was wrong, but you weren&#8217;t prepared to find out you have diabetes. This worries you.</p>
<h3 class="h3">REASSURANCE</h3>
<p class="noindent">A reassuring response attempts to make someone feel better, relieved, less frightened, or more confident. Although such responses are attempts to help or care, they are often motivated by the anxiety of the person providing them. That is, one person says something that indicates he or she feels frightened or overwhelmed. The other person gives a reassuring response (&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;ll be OK&#8221;) in an attempt to relieve his or her own anxiety about not knowing how to help or alleviate the problem. Reassuring responses work best when the other person asks for reassurance. They can backfire when the person does not ask for reassurance and really just wants to be understood. The following two examples should help clarify this.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 1</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Have other patients told you they were afraid to give themselves allergy shots?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_161"/>Pharmacist: They sure have. I feel confident that, like other patients, you&#8217;ll have no problem with it after some practice. I&#8217;ll be glad to show you how to do it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Great. I&#8217;d like that. Thanks.</p>
<p class="indentt">Reassurance worked here because the patient asked for it. The patient did not want to feel alone in her fear, so she asked if other patients had this problem. She needed reassurance that she was not alone in being afraid.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 2</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I just feel so overwhelmed. I finally get my blood pressure under control and now I find out I have asthma. What next?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Mrs. Smith, it&#8217;s not so bad. Asthma can be controlled. You&#8217;ll be OK.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: What do you mean, it&#8217;s not so bad? Do you have high blood pressure? Do you have asthma? It&#8217;s easy for you to stand there and say it&#8217;s not so bad!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Calm down. It&#8217;s going to be all right.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Don&#8217;t tell me to calm down! This isn&#8217;t happening to you.</p>
<p class="indentt">What happened here? Was the pharmacist trying to be caring? The pharmacist wanted to show caring, but his responses were motivated by his anxiety and his desire to fix the problem rather than simply be emotionally available to Mrs. Smith. The pharmacist hoped that if he could fix the problem, he would not have to feel anxious. Mrs. Smith&#8217;s reaction shows that this did not happen.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PROBING OR QUESTIONING</h3>
<p class="noindent">This type of response, particularly if questions are opened-ended, is useful when you are interested in receiving information from the patient or from the patient&#8217;s perspective. This type of response usually works well when factual information is needed, but it can be problematic when emotional issues are involved.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_162"/><em>Example 1</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient&#8217;s mother: I don&#8217;t know what to do. She&#8217;s been coughing like this for a while.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I know you&#8217;re worried about Sara. When did you first notice the cough?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient&#8217;s mother: About 3 days ago.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Please tell me about any other symptoms you&#8217;ve noticed, like fever or sore throat.</p>
<p class="indentt">As you can see, probing and questioning here are very important for gathering information so that an informed decision can be made about a product recommendation or referral to a physician. Notice that the pharmacist first acknowledged the mother&#8217;s concern. Let&#8217;s look at a situation where this type of response may not be very effective.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Example 2</em></h3>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Thirty-five dollars? You&#8217;re kidding. I can&#8217;t afford that!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re worth it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: That&#8217;s not the point. It&#8217;s a lot of money.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: And don&#8217;t you think that helping your arthritis is worth $35? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve spent more money on less important things than your health.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I can&#8217;t believe this. Where do you get off?</p>
<p class="indentt">Obviously, probing and questioning did not work here. That&#8217;s because there was no attempt to understand the patient&#8217;s perspective. In fact, the questioning was manipulative and was really an attempt to bully the patient, even though it was disguised as being reasonable. Too often, we use probing and questioning to &#8220;get the facts,&#8221; when seeking first to understand the world from the patient&#8217;s perspective would be more beneficial.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_163"/>ADVISING</h3>
<p class="noindent">As with many of the other responses, there are times when advising is appropriate and times when it is not. In general, advising is appropriate when you are clearly the expert. Otherwise, advising should be avoided or used very cautiously. Let&#8217;s look at two examples.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 1</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: I have some burning and itching between my toes. Do you think it could be athlete&#8217;s foot? (Patient is wearing sandals and pharmacist examines his feet.)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It sure looks like it. I highly recommend this product (hands it to patient). It is very effective against athlete&#8217;s foot fungus. I also recommend drying your feet thoroughly after bathing and wearing clean white socks until the fungus clears up. The dye in some dark socks can irritate the areas that are affected. If you need to wear dark socks, wear a pair of white socks underneath. Now, let me explain how to use this.</p>
<p class="indentt">In this situation, the patient is asking for help and the pharmacist is clearly the expert. Therefore, advice giving is not only appropriate but helpful. By giving advice in a quiet and confident way, the pharmacist gains the patient&#8217;s trust and makes the patient feel comfortable with asking questions in the future.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 2</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: (30-year-old woman) I&#8217;ve been taking these birth control pills for 3 years now and my husband says I need to keep taking them. We don&#8217;t want to have a baby yet, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of taking something like this for so long. He wants me to because it&#8217;s convenient for him. What do you think I should do?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It&#8217;s your body. If you don&#8217;t want to take them, don&#8217;t. He can&#8217;t tell you what to do. He&#8217;s your husband, not your boss.</p>
<p class="indentt">There is truth in what the pharmacist says, but is saying it appropriate or wise? Who is the expert here? Clearly the patient is the expert (at least more so than the pharmacist) on her relationship with her husband. In this situation, we don&#8217;t know the whole picture or all of the variables. We don&#8217;t know for certain if her husband really said what she claims he <a id="page_164"/>did. It is possible that he did. It is also possible that the patient wants to be able to go home and tell her husband that the pharmacist said to stop taking the pill. The problem with the advice given here is that the pharmacist may not be prepared to deal with an angry husband when he comes into the pharmacy. Issues need to be sorted. The pharmacist could give expert counseling to both the husband and wife on different methods of birth control and relate to both of them the risks of the various methods. This would be appropriate and helpful. It is ultimately up to the couple to sort this out and decide which method is best for them. That is their decision, no one else&#8217;s. If the patient wants to know what to do, the pharmacist can simply state that she would be happy to talk to the patient and her husband about the risks of long-term use and effectiveness of the pill and other methods of birth control, but that it is entirely up to her and her husband which method they choose.</p>
<h3 class="h3">GENERALIZING OR COMPARING</h3>
<p class="noindent">This type of response, like reassurance, is sometimes useful when patients are looking for a guarantee or wanting to feel less alone. However, it may not work in situations in which patients want to be understood and don&#8217;t want their problems compared with anyone else&#8217;s problems. Here are two examples.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 1</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Can you guarantee that this medicine is gonna keep me from having a stroke or heart attack?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: If you take this medicine the way you should, lower your salt intake and cholesterol, and get some exercise, I can guarantee that you will greatly reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack. This medicine has been shown to be very effective in treating high blood pressure if taken properly.</p>
<p class="indentt">The patient wants a guarantee that he won&#8217;t have a stroke or a heart attack if he takes the medicine. Although we cannot guarantee that that won&#8217;t happen, we can speak generally about decreasing risk factors. Generalizing is effective in this situation.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><em>Example 2</em></h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient&#8217;s father: My poor baby. She&#8217;s really had a hard time with these ear infections. This is the second antibiotic in the last 3 months.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_165"/>Pharmacist: (matter-of-factly) This seems to be the age for this. We see lots of kids with ear infections.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient&#8217;s father: Is that supposed to make me feel better? My little girl is suffering.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I&#8217;m sure she is.</p>
<p class="indentt">Like reassurance, generalizing or comparing runs the risk of minimizing the problem in the eyes of the person presenting it. A way to avoid this is to respond empathically and wait and see if the patient asks for a comparison. That would indicate that reassurance is wanted, and the pharmacist could respond, &#8220;It certainly is distressing for both you and your baby when she gets an ear infection. It&#8217;s a helpless feeling when kids are suffering&#8221; and then wait to see what direction the parent goes next. Like reassurance, comparisons and generalizations in such situations are often motivated by our own discomfort and usually are not helpful.</p>
<h3 class="h3">ASSERTIVE, AGGRESSIVE, AND NONASSERTIVE RESPONSES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The basic idea behind assertiveness is respect for self and respect for others. In other words, all human life has value and should therefore be respected. Aggressive people respect themselves but not others, and nonasssertive people respect others more than themselves. (See <a href="chapter7.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a> for more on this topic.) Let&#8217;s look at a dialogue in which the pharmacist responds using assertiveness, aggressiveness, and nonassertiveness. In this situation, a patient claims for the third time that the pharmacist shorted her five tablets on her prescription.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Assertiveness</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Oh, sir (calling to the pharmacist and holding up her bottle). I just went out to my car with this and you did it again. You shorted me five tablets.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Mrs. Smith, I saw on your record that we had shorted you twice before, so I was very careful and counted your tablets twice today to make sure that the problem did not occur again.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, even so, it happened again. I&#8217;m five tablets short. You must have counted wrong. I&#8217;m supposed to have 50 tablets and there are only 45 here.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_166"/>Pharmacist: I feel certain that I gave you 50 tablets. Therefore, I won&#8217;t be giving you five more tablets today.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (calmly) As I said, I was especially careful this time, so I won&#8217;t be giving you five more tablets today.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: This is ridiculous!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (calmly) I understand your frustration.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, I just might have to take my business elsewhere.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I hope you won&#8217;t, but that certainly is up to you.</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist remains calm and acknowledges the patient&#8217;s concerns but maintains his position. He does so in a way that shows respect for himself and the patient. Rather than caving in to manipulation, he allows the patient to choose what to do. The communication from the pharmacist is respectful, thoughtful, caring, and clear.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Aggressiveness</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Oh, sir (calling to the pharmacist and holding up her bottle). I just went out to my car with this, and you did it again. You shorted me five tablets.</p>
<p class="blockquote ">Pharmacist: We&#8217;re on to you, Mrs. Smith. We already went through this two other times with you, and it isn&#8217;t going to happen again.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: We know your game. We&#8217;re not going to give you extra tablets, so save your breath. We double-counted this time.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I&#8217;ve never been so insulted in all my life. I&#8217;ll never come back here again.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Fine.</p>
<p class="indentt">This pharmacist is disrespectful to the patient. He is more interested in winning and in shaming the patient than in solving a problem. He attacks the patient, not the problem. Embarrassing her solves nothing. <a id="page_167"/>It is sad that some people use the injustices of others to justify their own bad behavior. The fact that Mrs. Smith is trying to get away with something does not mean that she has to be treated like a criminal.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Nonassertiveness</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Oh, sir (calling to the pharmacist and holding up her bottle). I just went out to my car with this, and you did it again. You shorted me five tablets.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Oh, gosh, not again. I&#8217;m so sorry. I thought I got it right this time. I&#8217;ll get you five more.</p>
<p class="indentt">In this case, the pharmacist is afraid to assert that he has double-counted the tablets and is so afraid of upsetting the patient that he fails to respect himself. This gives the patient permission to continue her inappropriate behavior in the future.</p>
<h3 class="h3">JUDGING</h3>
<p class="noindent">The last response we will discuss is judging. There really isn&#8217;t any benefit to this response, unless needing to be self-righteous is important. This response alienates people and shows a lack of understanding and a desire to be right rather than caring. Here&#8217;s an example of judging.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Technician: I am so upset at Mrs. Brown. She is never nice to anyone when she comes in and never has anything pleasant to say. She criticizes everything.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: You obviously don&#8217;t know how to handle Mrs. Brown. Don&#8217;t take things so personally. You&#8217;re overreacting.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Technician: Thanks a lot! Sorry I&#8217;m not as perfect as you!</p>
<p class="indentt">The pharmacist does not listen to the technician&#8217;s feelings. The technician is hurt and frustrated. The pharmacist could help the technician more by being understanding than by judging her behavior. Telling people they are overreacting is simply insensitive and a way to try to put them in their place. It is not at all caring. A more caring response would have been, &#8220;I know that you&#8217;re very frustrated. Mrs. Brown really is difficult to deal with. She&#8217;s hard person to be around.&#8221; This response has a higher probability of eliciting an inquiry from the technician about how the pharmacist handles Mrs. Brown.
