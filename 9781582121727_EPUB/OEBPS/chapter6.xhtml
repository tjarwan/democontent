<h2 class="h2a"><em>MANAGING THE ANGRY PATIENT</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">Anger is part of being human. We see it expressed everywhere. Sometimes it is for good reason, sometimes not. Anger can be a very difficult emotion. Anger is referred to as an offense-taking emotion, as are hatred, disdain, and contempt. More on this concept will be presented later in the chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Both our own anger and other people&#8217;s anger can create problems for us. Anger can frighten some, create more anger in others, and result in unclear thinking and impaired ability to solve problems.</p>
<p class="indent">There are no quick fixes in learning how to manage anger more effectively. We must first learn to understand our own anger and our responses to anger and whether these responses escalate others&#8217; anger or focus on solving problems. This chapter will explore the origins of anger and how to begin to respond to our own anger and that of our patients in ways that are more effective.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT IS ANGER AND WHAT CAUSES IT?</h3>
<p class="noindent">Anger is a feeling. It is not bad or good any more than joy or hurt or fear is bad or good. It is not feeling anger that causes problems for us. It is what we choose to do when we feel angry that can be either productive or nonproductive. Anger does not feel good (it may initially, but not in the long run) and, generally speaking, anger is not acceptable in our culture. But the feeling of anger needs to be differentiated from the inappropriate expression of anger.</p>
<p class="indent">Almost always, anger is a secondary emotion. That is, it occurs after some other feeling occurs. Often we feel angry after we first felt afraid or hurt. We feel angry in the face of criticism, but probably we first felt hurt. This is important to understand. The anger is a response to a threat or some form of injustice. It is used to block physical or emotional pain. If I hit my finger with a hammer, anger is a common response. <a id="page_76"/>If I feel slighted or hurt as a result of someone&#8217;s unkind words, I may use anger to cover my hurt, since anger feels better and more powerful than hurt. So, anger blocks the feeling of being hurt or afraid or in pain at some level.</p>
<p class="indent">Anger also allows us to vent frustration over life&#8217;s everyday difficulties and general unfairness. Although anger can be an effective way of venting, it can create problems. It can allow us to escape the core feelings that the anger is attempting to mask. Problems can arise when we suppress or repress anger or when we express it inappropriately. Let&#8217;s look at each of these.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUPPRESSED ANGER</h3>
<p class="noindent">Anger that is suppressed or repressed builds up and may eventually be let out in some type of explosion. Or, it may produce a dandy ulcer, heart disease, or other stress-related disorder. Suppressed anger is anger from the past. It is left over from past events. There are three types of suppressed anger: adult suppressed anger, cultural suppressed anger, and infantile suppressed anger.<sup><a id="ch6-ref1" href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6_ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Adult suppressed anger is a result of injustices and events that have happened to us since we became old enough to take care of or defend ourselves.<sup><a href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6_ref1">1</a></sup> Infantile anger, on the other hand, results from events or injustices that happened to us when we were not old enough to take care of or defend ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultural anger is a result of events or injustices that occur because of cultural norms or rules. This could include, for example, objectification of women by our culture so that a beautiful woman is not taken as seriously as a male counterpart.</p>
<p class="indent">All of these types of suppressed anger need to be dealt with, or inappropriate responses may prevail. For example, a patient&#8217;s having to wait 15 minutes for a prescription may seem to be a small inconvenience, but an explosion may occur if the patient has a great deal of suppressed anger and decides to express it. Anger like this, which is not from the present moment, can be dangerous. If pharmacists see an unusually angry response from a patient, they may be dealing with suppressed anger and should consider taking appropriate actions, such as calling security personnel if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">When anger is suppressed or repressed, we lose information about who we are and how we respond to the world. We lose touch with our core feelings, which are feedback about how we navigate life. Again, we need to know when we are hurt, afraid, angry, happy, and so on, and what causes these feelings, so that we can grow and mature.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_77"/>INAPPROPRIATE EXPRESSION OF ANGER</h3>
<p class="noindent">Anger that is expressed in the form of rage, passive-aggressive behavior, or defensiveness creates problems because the real issues generally don&#8217;t get addressed. Many people find it difficult to stay in a problem-solving mode when someone is yelling or raging. It is also very difficult to solve problems when people behave in passive-aggressive ways.</p>
<h3 class="h3">HOW ANGER COMES UP</h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig6.1">Figure 6-1</a> shows the process of anger. The process starts with something that stresses us physically or emotionally (a stressor). Let&#8217;s use an example of a patient who always comes into the pharmacy and complains about something (we call him our PITA&#8212;pain in the&#8230;).</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Smith always finds something to complain about, whether it&#8217;s the weather, the cost of his medicine, or how long he has to wait. Sound familiar? Many pharmacists have a patient like this. In fact, whenever that person comes in, the pharmacist usually sends the clerk or technician out to wait on him or her. Mr. Smith comes in, and the pharmacist says to the clerk, with frustration and disdain in his voice, &#8220;Oh, not him again. Go wait on him. He drives me crazy!&#8221;</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/page77.jpg" alt="Image"/></p>
<p class="caption" id="fig6.1"><strong>FIGURE 6-1</strong> The Process of Anger</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_78"/>What is the stressor? The stressor is Mr. Smith (or so we think&#8212;more on this later). What is the painful core feeling? It is anxiety. The pharmacist feels anxious. Why? Probably because he believes that he needs to make Mr. Smith happy. We call someone like Mr. Smith a PITA or difficult person, but the real problem is that we don&#8217;t know what to do with such people. Think about this. They are very consistent in their behavior: They always come in and complain. So what? The real problem is that we often feel the need to fix whatever the &#8220;difficult person&#8221; thinks is wrong. A key to managing your own anger and that of others is being able to stay separate from the other&#8212;the ability to see that the person&#8217;s complaining or anger or frustration really has nothing to do with you or who you are. The difficult person is simply mad at life, and you can&#8217;t fix that.</p>
<p class="indent">The next part of <a href="#fig6.1">Figure 6-1</a> is trigger statements. Trigger statements are things we say to ourselves (sometimes out loud) in response to the stressor and painful core feelings. In this example, they would be statements such as &#8220;Oh, not him. Why does he always have to complain?&#8221; &#8220;Why does he always have to come in when I&#8217;m working?&#8221; &#8220;This isn&#8217;t right. All he ever does is complain.&#8221; Notice that all of these statements express some type of injustice or expectation about how life <em>ought</em> to be. It is these internal statements that turn the painful core feeling into anger. This is important to understand. It is not what Mr. Smith says or does that creates our anger. It is our own beliefs, expectations, and values about how the world ought to be that create our anger.</p>
<p class="indent">Let me give you another example. I was flying from Philadelphia to Atlanta last summer when the pilot announced that we were being put into a holding pattern because of thunderstorms in the Atlanta area. The pilot said he would get back to us when we were cleared to land. To me, circling sounded much better than trying to land in a thunderstorm. But the man sitting next to me became very agitated. He asked the flight attendant when we would be able to land, and she said she didn&#8217;t know. He then became more agitated and said, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;ve got to be at a meeting 45 minutes after we were supposed to land. It is a very important meeting and I need to be there on time!&#8221; The flight attendant told the man that there was nothing she could do and asked him to sit back and relax. He then looked at me and said angrily, &#8220;Can you believe this? Sit back and relax? Sure, it&#8217;s easy for her to say. She&#8217;s not going to be late for the meeting!&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">What was the stressor? The plane was being delayed and he was going to be late for his meeting. What was the painful core feeling? Anxiety or fear of being reprimanded for being late. What were his trigger statements? Probably, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t fair! Why does this have to happen to me?&#8221; This led to his anger and to acting it out with the flight attendant. It never occurred to this man (or to the pharmacist in the previous <a id="page_79"/>example) that he had a choice. For him, feeling angry and acting it out was completely warranted, appropriate, and the only response. His other option, of course, was to ask himself why he was anxious and what was the worst that could happen. If he was really working for a company that would not understand why he was late in this case, then he certainly did have reason to feel stressed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">OFFENSE-TAKING EMOTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let&#8217;s consider another way of viewing anger. What follows is a sequence that can result in an angry response or a feeling that we have been victimized. This material is based on the work of C. Terry Warner and the Arbinger Company.<sup><a id="ch6-ref2" href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6_ref2">2</a>,<a id="ch6-ref3" href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6_ref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Offense-taking emotions and attitudes include anger, hatred, and contempt. To take offense is to express a judgment about the object of our anger (seeing the other as doing us wrong). We say, &#8220;He/she wronged me&#8230;treated me unfairly&#8230;talked disrespectfully to me.&#8221; A judgment or accusation is made about the other and what the other has done. To accuse others is to present oneself as being harmed or upset by the other. We insist that those we accuse have caused our agitated state and that we are victimized by them. It is because of what the other has said or done that we are agitated or harmed. We claim that the other is responsible for our emotional state and for our suffering, and therefore we bear no responsibility. We are passive and are simply responding. We are a victim of the attack.</p>
<p class="indent">This is fundamentally dishonest&#8212;a self-deception. We are not passive. We have caused our own agitation by the judgment or meaning we assign to the event or action. We say, &#8220;You are the problem here, not me!&#8221; We say, &#8220;How can she expect compassion and understanding when she treats me like this?&#8221; We convince ourselves that the other no longer deserves compassion or caring because of how he or she treated us. We convince ourselves that the other person&#8217;s disrespect now deserves ours. Yet, it is the meaning we assigned to the whole event that created the problem in the first place. If Mr. Smith becomes very angry because he does not want to wait 15 minutes for his prescription, what does that have to do with you? It has everything to do with you if you think it is your job to make Mr. Smith happy (this is impossible). It is your belief, not Mr. Smith, that produces your distress. If you believe that your job is to be caring and compassionate, then you can still do this even if Mr. Smith is very unhappy. It does not mean that you have to fill his prescription in less than 15 minutes, though.</p>
<p class="indent">An angry response is a choice, and as such it is often inappropriate. It is often a response to a sense of injustice, but other responses (e.g., compassion, understanding) can be more appropriate.</p>
<p class="page">&#160;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_80"/>APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION OF ANGER</h3>
<p class="noindent">With this understanding of anger, let&#8217;s discuss how to appropriately manage angry patients. Let&#8217;s also set a few ground rules. First, it must be understood that once you make the decision to practice pharmacy, you also make the decision to serve people. As such, you enter into a nonreciprocal relationship with your patients.<sup><a id="ch6-ref4" href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6_ref4">4</a></sup> Essentially, when patients become angry and yell at you, you and all others who work in this professional environment do not have the right to yell back. You don&#8217;t lose your right to self-respect, just your right to yell back. More on this later.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, for pharmacists to operate effectively as professionals, the policy that &#8220;the customer is always right&#8221; must be abolished. The customer is not always right. If the customer were always right, then every time Mr. Brown insisted he had been shorted five tablets (tablets that cost the pharmacy $3 each), the pharmacist should give Mr. Brown five tablets even if she knows for a fact that she double-counted the tablets. I have heard people in upper management who espouse the &#8220;customer is always right&#8221; policy say that they want the pharmacist to use professional discretion in Mr. Brown&#8217;s case. I&#8217;m sorry, but you can&#8217;t have it both ways. You either empower your pharmacists to make reasonable decisions with reasonable people, or you always give Mr. Brown his five tablets. A policy that the customer is always right is a policy that puts the pharmacist in no man&#8217;s land with irrational, abusive patients. It can be disempowering and humiliating for the pharmacist.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to replace the &#8220;customer is always right&#8221; with the &#8220;customer deserves respect.&#8221; Even if patients behave in ways that are generally not acceptable, they deserve to be treated with respect. As discussed by Reich,<sup><a id="ch6-ref5" href="chapter6.xhtml#ch6_ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="blockquote">Respect for humans is not based on personhood.&#8230;What is sacred in human beings is not their person, but rather the impersonal in them, that is, it does not depend on what they personally accomplish in art, science, or whatever. Their sacredness is at the level where the highest things are achieved, and these things are essentially anonymous. Thus, respect for persons requires attention to the anonymous center of the individual that lies beyond any particular human characteristic.</p>
<p class="indentt">In other words, respect for people does not depend on accomplishments and is not diminished by bad behavior. As Reich suggests later in the same article, we owe people respect because disrespecting humans disrespects that which created us. We certainly don&#8217;t have to like <a id="page_81"/>people&#8217;s bad behavior or put up with it, but their bad behavior does not give us permission to be disrespectful. However, having said this, pharmacists do not deserve to be disrespected either.</p>
<p class="indent">So, how can we respond to angry or abusive or disrespectful patients without being disrespectful in return? The process that is necessary involves listening, empathy, respect for others, respect for self, the ability to remain separate from others, and assertive communication.</p>
<h3 class="h3">DIALOGUES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let&#8217;s take a look at two different dialogues between an angry patient and a pharmacist in which the pharmacist does not use the above process. In the first dialogue, the pharmacist is aggressive. In the second, he is nonassertive. Then let&#8217;s look at how the same dialogues can be more productive if the process is used.</p>
<p class="indent">A 45-year-old female patient enters the pharmacy and tosses a new prescription on the counter. She is obviously very agitated. You have never met her before.</p>
<h4 class="h4">DIALOGUE 1</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Here. (tosses prescription down) That&#8217;s not going to take long, is it? (angrily)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Well, I&#8217;ve got four other patients in front of you, so it&#8217;s gonna take about 20 minutes. (indifferently)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Twenty minutes! You&#8217;ve got to be kidding. I had a 2 pm appointment with the doctor and he didn&#8217;t even see me until 3:15. Now I&#8217;m late for my next appointment. You people must think we have nothing better to do than to wait on you! Besides, all you have to do is throw a few damn pills in a bottle. What could take so long? (angrily and quite loudly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I do more than just throw a few damn pills in a bottle! Look lady, I have four other people in front of you and it&#8217;s gonna take 20 minutes. Take it or leave it. It&#8217;s not my fault the doctor made you late.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Just give me my prescription back. I&#8217;ll take it elsewhere!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Fine!</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_82"/>Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist was aggressive, defensive, and antagonistic. True, the patient may have been difficult to deal with, insulting, and disrespectful, but that did not give the pharmacist permission to be disrespectful in return. The pharmacist did not see this situation as an opportunity to assist the patient. Assisting the patient would not have meant that the pharmacist had to fill the prescription in 5 minutes or less. If other patients were waiting, their needs had to be considered and respected along with those of the current patient. However, the patient could have been offered other options. We will discuss these later.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 2</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Here. (tosses prescription down) That&#8217;s not going to take long, is it? (angrily)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Uh, well, there are four other patients waiting for their prescriptions, so it&#8217;s going to take about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Twenty minutes! You&#8217;ve got to be kidding. I had a 2 pm appointment with the doctor and he didn&#8217;t even see me until 3:15. Now I&#8217;m late for my next appointment. You people must think we have nothing better to do than to wait on you! Besides, all you have to do is throw a few damn pills in a bottle. What could take so long? (angrily and quite loudly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Sorry.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Sorry? Is that the best you can do? This is pathetic. If you can&#8217;t get my prescription for me in 5 minutes I&#8217;ll take it elsewhere!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: Well, I&#8217;ll do the best I can.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: No, you don&#8217;t understand. I want it in less than 5 minutes! What is wrong with you people?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: OK, I&#8217;ll get it for you right away. Sorry.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, you ought to be sorry. Just get me my prescription!</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">This pharmacist is nonassertive, and in the process of pleasing an abusive patient he fails to respect himself. This will create future problems, <a id="page_83"/>because the patient now knows that if she complains enough she will get what she wants. In addition, other patients who are waiting may become angry because the pharmacist put this new patient ahead of them. Certainly, if the other patients were not present this might be a viable alternative; however, the new patient should have been told, &#8220;Mrs. Smith, because you are in such a hurry, I am going to go ahead and fill your prescription first. I do want you to know that I am making an exception and may not be able to do this again in the future.&#8221; Moreover, while the pharmacist should be as helpful and respectful as possible, he does not have to apologize for this patient&#8217;s problems. He did not create those problems.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dialogue 3</h4>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Patient: Here. (tosses prescription down) That&#8217;s not going to take long, is it?(angrily)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: I have four other patients who are waiting for their prescriptions, so it will be about 20 minutes. (calmly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Twenty minutes! You&#8217;ve got to be kidding. I had a 2 pm appointment with the doctor and he didn&#8217;t even see me until 3:15. Now I&#8217;m late for my next appointment. You people must think we have nothing better to do than to wait on you! Besides, all you have to do is throw a few damn pills in a bottle. What could take so long? (angrily and quite loudly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: It sounds like you&#8217;ve had a very frustrating day. It&#8217;s irritating when you&#8217;re busy and people don&#8217;t keep their appointed times. Again, I do have four other patients in front of you, so it will take 20 minutes. I want to be sure I am accurate when I get my patients&#8217; medications for them.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: This is ridiculous! What the hell is wrong with you people? You and the doctor are all alike, making me wait!</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (looks at prescription) Mrs. Smith, I know you&#8217;re frustrated and I want to get your prescription for you as fast as I can. However, I don&#8217;t want to be sworn at or yelled at. If you continue to swear and yell at me, I will ask you to leave. Now, I&#8217;d like to go ahead and get started so that you aren&#8217;t delayed any more. (calmly)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Just give me my prescription. If you can&#8217;t get it in 5 minutes, I&#8217;ll just take it elsewhere. I don&#8217;t have time to wait. (still agitated but somewhat calmer)</p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_84"/>Pharmacist: If that&#8217;s what you feel like you need to do, I understand. Is there a pharmacy you plan to go? I can call ahead and tell them that you are on the way so they can get started. Or, would you like to use the phone and call your next appointment and let them know you&#8217;re running late?</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: I don&#8217;t know. (very frustrated, but calmer) Just give me the prescription.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Pharmacist: (hands over prescription) Here you are. I hope you get to your next appointment on time.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Patient: Well, I probably won&#8217;t.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The pharmacist in this situation does not allow the patient&#8217;s &#8220;bad day&#8221; to ruin his. He is able to stay separate from the patient and her problem and is therefore able to be respectful and caring to both himself and the patient. He lets the patient know that he understands her frustration, but he also sets limits by telling the patient that he does not want to be sworn at or yelled at. Although he disapproves of her behavior, he is still respectful toward her. He uses assertive communication to do this. Assertive communication respects oneself and the other.</p>
<p class="indent">When it seems clear to this pharmacist that nothing he will say or do is going to work with this patient, he still does not take it personally. He takes the high ground and offers to call ahead to a pharmacy of her choice or let her use the phone. This communicates his interest in helping her, even if she is difficult to be around. This is a powerful message and one that can have an unlimited positive impact on her and any other patients who may have observed what took place. The pharmacist focused on serving without losing his own self-respect.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Angry patients can give you an opportunity to demonstrate caring, respect, and civility in the face of adversity. Even if behaving in these ways does not calm the patient down, most people will think later about how respectfully they were treated (and be somewhat embarrassed by their own behavior). You have not burned any bridges, and you have not reacted in a way that gives other patients a negative impression. You can go home at the end of the day feeling good about your responses.</p>
