<h2 class="h2a"><em>CULTURAL COMPETENCE</em></h2>
<p class="chapauthor">Amanda K. Diggs and Bruce A. Berger</p>
<p class="noindent">Cultural diversity is increasing in the United States. African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic Americans accounted for 30&#37; of the population in 2000 and were projected to account for 40&#37; by 2005.<sup><a id="ch15-ref1" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref1">1</a>,<a id="ch15-ref2" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref2">2</a></sup> Many employers, including educational institutions, business, government, and health care organizations, have responded with a new emphasis on cultural competence. In health care, cultural competence means having the ability to provide care to patients with diverse values, beliefs, and behaviors and to tailor care delivery to patients&#8217; social, cultural, and linguistic needs.<sup><a id="ch15-ref3" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref3">3</a></sup> Cultural competence training seminars, courses, definitions, books, and curricula have been developed to prepare the workforce to meet the needs and challenges of a diverse population.</p>
<p class="indent">Paradoxically, many of the resources for teaching cultural competence focus on the health beliefs and behaviors of specific ethnic groups. Although this is a vital component of cultural competence, misapplication of the information can lead to stereotyping. Furthermore, health care professionals may find it difficult to assess the value and quality of resources on cultural competence. Often, we have to work with cultural competence formulas that inherently produce culturally incompetent outcomes in the form of stereotyping or cultural insensitivity. For example, profiles may be used to help health care practitioners become knowledgeable about various cultures. One such profile states that pregnant African American women from the South have a craving for red clay (a condition called pica). This may be true of certain women in that group, but it is erroneous to assume that all pregnant southern African American women crave clay.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_200"/>This chapter considers how health care providers can, without stereotyping, become culturally competent to provide quality care and improve outcomes for all patients. The first step is understanding the disparities and inequalities that exist and how they negatively affect health outcomes for minority populations. Then, it is necessary to understand how our own cultural backgrounds affect the way we interpret, assign meaning to, and create value judgments about the behavior of other people and how this in turn affects the care we provide.</p>
<h3 class="h3">HEALTH CARE INEQUITIES EXIST</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Institute of Medicine<sup><a id="ch15-ref4" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> reports that racial and ethnic disparities in health care are consistent across illnesses and health care services. Williams<sup><a id="ch15-ref5" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref5">5</a></sup> suggests that health disparities may reflect socioeconomic differences, differences in health-related risk factors, environmental degradation, and direct and indirect consequences of discrimination. Racial and ethnic minorities tend to receive substandard health care, and, with few exceptions, have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than whites, regardless of insurance status, income, age, comorbid conditions, and the duration and severity of symptoms.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Discrimination, stereotyping, biases, and uncertainty on the part of health care providers have been identified as contributors to disparities in care.</p>
<p class="indent">Educating health care providers may be the best approach to remedying disparities. In the clinical environment, providers have more power than patients do; they establish the tone, setting, and length of each encounter. Therefore, changing the expectations, perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and values of health care providers is a more practical goal than attempting to bring about change through the health care system or through patients.</p>
<p class="indent">The racism and inequality that exist in contemporary American society can be traced back to the times of slavery and legal segregation. Today, minorities are overrepresented in lower socioeconomic groups, receive poorer educations, and have lower-paying jobs.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> However, many Americans believe that racism, discrimination, and inequality have largely been eradicated. In a national public opinion poll commissioned by the Harvard Forums on Health,<sup><a id="ch15-ref6" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref6">6</a></sup> 52&#37; of whites believed people of different races and ethnicities receive equal treatment, but 20&#37; of whites and 65&#37; of African Americans believed minorities receive lower-quality health care than whites. Almost half (48&#37;) of Hispanics believed minorities and whites get the same quality of care, whereas 41&#37; believed minorities receive lower-quality care. Overall, 54&#37; of Americans believed health care professionals treat minority and white patients differently.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_201"/>For pharmacists to attain cultural competence, they must understand the existing racial disparities in the quality of care provided. Racial and ethnic minorities are less likely than their white counterparts to receive even routine medical care.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Mortality from heart disease is higher in African Americans than in any other racial or ethnic group;<sup><a id="ch15-ref7" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref7">7</a></sup> in 1999 it was about 30&#37; higher than for whites. African Americans are less likely to receive appropriate cardiac medication and less likely to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> African Americans also have the highest rates of death from cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV/AIDS.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> HIV infection is the leading cause of death among African Americans between the ages of 25 and 44,<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref7">7</a></sup> but African Americans are far less likely than whites to receive treatment that can delay disability due to HIV. African Americans are more than twice as likely as whites to not receive triple-drug antiretroviral therapy; they are 1.5 times less likely than whites to receive preventive treatment for <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> pneumonia.<sup>4,7</sup> In addition, African Americans with end-stage renal disease are less likely to receive peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplants.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> In hospital emergency departments, African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to receive analgesia for bone fractures.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Racial disparities between African Americans and whites also exist in diabetes care, pediatric care, maternal and child health care, mental health care, rehabilitative and nursing home services, and many surgical procedures.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">American Indians have a disproportionately high rate of death from diabetes, liver disease, and cirrhosis, as well as from unintentional injuries.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref7">7</a></sup> The frequency of diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives is more than twice that in the total U.S. population.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref7">7</a></sup> The Pima people of Arizona have the highest known prevalence of diabetes in the world.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref7">7</a></sup> In addition, Hispanic Americans are almost twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to die from diabetes.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> And some Asian Americans have rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancers that are well above national averages.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h4">Patient Factors</h4>
<p class="noindent">Pharmacists need to be sensitive to the cultural, societal, political, and economic factors that shape the attitudes, beliefs, and values of minority patient populations. Ethnic and racial disparities exist in many sectors of American society, such as employment practices, housing, education, banking, and finance. Studies have identified several minority patient attributes that affect care.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Minority patients are more likely to refuse services, be noncompliant with treatment regimens, and delay seeking treatment; however, these differences probably are not the main source of health care disparities.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> The slightly greater likelihood of minorities&#8217; <a id="page_202"/>refusing care, for example, fails to fully account for disparities in the receipt of treatment.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Mistrust of providers, misunderstanding of instructions, and fewer encounters with the health care system have been identified as reasons why minorities are less likely to seek care.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h4">Provider Factors</h4>
<p class="noindent">Prejudice, stereotypes of the behavior of minorities, and greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority populations contribute to treatment disparities.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Health care providers&#8217; diagnostic and treatment decisions and their feelings about patients are influenced by race and ethnicity.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> In a study based on actual clinical encounters, physicians rated African American subjects as less intelligent, less educated, more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, more likely to fail to comply with medical advice, more likely to lack social support, and less likely to participate in cardiac rehabilitation than white patients, even after factors such as patients&#8217; income, education, and personal characteristics were taken into account.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref7">7</a></sup> This suggests that, at some level, providers&#8217; attitudes about patients are influenced by race and ethnicity.</p>
<p class="indent">Studies suggest that providers experience greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority populations.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> In diagnosing illness, physicians rely on their observations of the patient (including the patient&#8217;s race, age, sex, and socioeconomic status), as well as on information the patient provides. If physicians lack information or suspect information is inaccurate, perhaps because of cultural or language barriers, they must rely on their own observations and inferences in making diagnostic and treatment decisions. The more providers must rely on their own inferences, the greater is the chance that treatment decisions are influenced by personal biases and stereotypes. A physician&#8217;s uncertainty about patients&#8217; conditions can contribute to treatment disparities.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h3">CASE STUDIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The following case studies illustrate how prevailing societal factors influence the quality of care. The first case demonstrates how racism outside the health care arena can influence the patient and the pharmacist. The second case demonstrates the effect of racism within the health care system.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Case Study 1</h4>
<p class="noindent">The pharmacist tried to accommodate the obviously frustrated mother, but he could not help being irritated when she asked about a generic <a id="page_203"/>substitute. He believed her child&#8217;s health was far more important than saving money. In the 6 months the pharmacist had worked in this predominantly African American, low-income neighborhood, he had come to the conclusion that many black mothers placed saving money above the safety and health of their children. Often when a mother discovered the price of a medication, she opted to leave it at the store, only to return days later or not at all. He had seen mothers buying nonprescription products instead of filling prescriptions. He could not make them understand the importance of not delaying the treatment of a sick child. It irritated him to see &#8220;illiterate, unwed welfare mothers with too many kids, who spent their money on expensive clothes and thick gold chains&#8221; but could not seem to afford medication for a sick child.</p>
<p class="indent">When the pharmacist explained to the woman that there was no generic substitute for the prescription, she asked whether she could buy half the prescription, or a few days&#8217; worth of the medication, which at $84, was too expensive for her. The pharmacist sighed and said, &#8220;Sure,&#8221; thinking that it would be a waste of time to stress to her the importance of administering the medication as prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">This mother, Connie, age 35, had always dreamed of becoming a teacher, but her high school guidance counselor urged her to take vocational courses, which was typical for the African American and poor white students. The practice of steering these students into vocational school was so well established that Connie never thought to question it. She remembers thinking that only white kids and really smart African Americans took the college preparatory courses, and it never occurred to her to not get on the bus that carted her off to vo-tech school. Only two African Americans in Connie&#8217;s graduating class received college preparatory diplomas. Connie studied cosmetology, which she hated.</p>
<p class="indent">When Connie decided to try for college, she was shocked to discover how ill-prepared she was. To pass the entrance exams, she needed to know subjects such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and physics. Her business math from the vocational school was insufficient. Connie gave up on college. She became a teaching assistant working with autistic children. She loves the students but suffers the consequences of not having more education. She and her husband have four children and no health insurance.</p>
<p class="indent">As she waited for her prescription, Connie daydreamed about how different life could have been if she had chosen to take academic rather than vocational courses. That one decision had influenced her income, where she lived, where her children went to school, whether they saw a physician, and whether she could afford to buy medication when they were sick. She took offense at the pharmacist&#8217;s rudeness and superior attitude. Since he was rude to all of the African American patients, she <a id="page_204"/>surmised that he was prejudiced. She considered taking her business elsewhere but decided it was too inconvenient.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">Patients&#8217; experiences with pharmacists occur within a larger cultural context. Many minority patients bring to the pharmacy experiences shaped by racism, prejudice, and discrimination. Connie traced her inability to pay for the medication back to high school. She believed she had received a vocational education because of her race and social status rather than her intellect or potential. Since Connie had never mistreated the pharmacist and he did not know her personally, she thought his poor treatment of her was based on race. She could think of no other reason for his obvious contempt, disrespect, and apathy.</p>
<p class="indent">We all have preconceived ideas based on overly broad generalizations and riddled with stereotypes. These ideas help us make sense of our world, but failure to reexamine our preconceived notions often leads to discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the pharmacist misjudged the patient. Connie was not illiterate, unwed, or on welfare. She did not wear expensive clothes and had never owned a thick gold chain. Instead, Connie and her husband were among the working poor: They made too much money to qualify for government assistance but too little to make ends meet. However, the pharmacist&#8217;s stereotyping led to discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">Our cultural background affects how we interpret, assign meaning to, and create value judgments about the behavior of other people. Pharmacists must examine their own sources of bias and prejudice and how they affect the quality of their patient care. The pharmacist in this case study should evaluate his bias against the African American mothers who use his pharmacy. He should understand its source in his own culturally influenced belief system, and he should ask himself how it affects his patient care.</p>
<p class="indent">This pharmacist did not understand the cultural, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical environment of the patients he served. Pharmacists need to get to know their patients through relationships based on trust and respect. They should emphasize caring. When the goal is to tailor drug therapy to produce positive outcomes for each individual patient, there is no room for racial discrimination. Using this approach, pharmacists can begin to replace prejudice with sensitivity and compassion.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Case Study 2</h4>
<p class="noindent">Bernard, a 40-year-old correctional officer with insurance that includes a dental plan, has not visited a dentist since childhood. He remembers <a id="page_205"/>that the local dentist he visited as a child&#8212;the only dentist in town&#8212;was a self-proclaimed racist. When Bernard had a toothache, the dentist yanked out the tooth, often using no pain medication. Bernard&#8217;s mouth is riddled with gaps where teeth used to be. Although Bernard realizes he should have a dental checkup, especially since he has dental insurance, his mistrust of dentists is so great that he avoids even basic preventive care.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">As in this case, patients&#8217; experiences of racism within the health care system breed mistrust of both the system and providers. The health care industry has never been immune to racism and discriminatory practices. During the era of legal segregation, &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; health care meant substandard treatment of minorities, in substandard facilities. The infamous Tuskegee syphilis study only fueled the perception that African Americans were being used as guinea pigs by the health care system. Even today, some African Americans believe there were many other such studies that have been covered up. Many African Americans remain suspicious of the health care system. Some refuse to participate in studies and refuse procedures, treatments, and medications. African Americans may distrust generic medications, be noncompliant with their regimens, or use herbals or home remedies. Because many minorities, like Bernard, are not convinced that health care providers have their best interests at heart, they may avoid the system altogether.</p>
<h3 class="h3">ACKNOWLEDGING OUR OWN CULTURAL BIASES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The term <em>culture</em> was introduced by anthropologist Edward B. Tylor in 1871. Culture is a complex whole that includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other habits acquired by members of society.<sup><a id="ch15-ref8" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref8">8</a></sup> American society has two categories of culture: mainstream culture and co-culture.</p>
<p class="indent">Mainstream culture consists of the most common language, the basic social institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals, fire departments, police, governments, courts), material artifacts, technologies, and the values to which most people subscribe.<sup><a id="ch15-ref9" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref9">9</a></sup> The mainstream culture enables diverse groups to coexist and interact in relatively predictable ways.</p>
<p class="indent">Co-cultures are specialized ways of life that distinguish societal groups based on race or ethnicity, sex, age, profession, religion, social class, region of the country, and other factors. Most Americans belong to several co-cultures that affect how they think, feel, and behave. For example, 72-year-old retired pharmacist John Smith identifies himself <a id="page_206"/>as a senior citizen, a retiree, a Democrat, a professional, a southerner, a Christian, and a white, middle-class American male (count the co-cultures).</p>
<p class="indent">All of us hold stereotypes about one group or another. The &#8220;ethnocentrism test&#8221; (page 209) is designed to identify our stereotypes of our own and others&#8217; co-cultures. Ethnocentrism means regarding ourselves or our way of life as superior. As members of co-cultures within a mainstream culture, we continually make judgments about others on the basis of our attitudes, beliefs, and values. Attitudes represent our preferences; they are simply our likes and dislikes. Beliefs represent what we hold to be true or false. Values express judgments about what is desirable or undesirable, right or wrong, good or evil. Our attitudes, beliefs, and values influence our behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, Sarah, a practicing pharmacist, has ethnocentric views about her professional status as a pharmacist, a co-culture. Sarah prefers pharmaceutical interventions over alternative forms of medicine, such as herbals (this is her attitude). She believes nonprescription herbal remedies pose a serious health threat because they are not regulated by the federal government. And Sarah makes a value judgment about herbalists. She thinks they offer false hope to desperate patients, who waste valuable time experimenting with herbs that have not been proven to work. She judges such practices to be unethical and wrong. Sarah&#8217;s attitudes, beliefs, and values about herbals affect her behavior in interactions with patients. Sarah is not unique in believing that her medicinal approach is best. Surgeons, oncologists, and acupuncturists, for example, all advocate their particular approaches.</p>
<p class="indent">Stereotyping is the process by which people use social categories (e.g., race, sex) in acquiring, processing, and recalling information about others.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> Stereotypes help us organize and simplify complex or uncertain situations and give us confidence in our ability to understand a situation and respond appropriately.<sup><a href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref4">4</a></sup> However, stereotyping can be dysfunctional because of its inherent biases and inaccuracies, especially if we use a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; model.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Case Study 3</h4>
<p class="noindent">Paula, a 73-year-old African American great-grandmother, made an appointment with her physician because her blood pressure kept going up. She had kept her blood pressure under control for the past couple of years, but now it was 154/100 mm Hg. The physician asked her if she was stressed, but before she could respond he said he would like to increase her medication dosage. He encouraged her to exercise, reduce her dietary fat and salt, and eat more fruits and vegetables. He said he wanted to do some blood work to make sure that everything else <a id="page_207"/>checked out. Before turning her over to the nurses, he wrote her a new prescription.</p>
<p class="indent">Paula was disappointed about the dosage increase, since she had worked hard to manage her blood pressure. Her goal had been to not need any high blood pressure medication at all someday. She decided to ask the pharmacist to recommend a natural product for high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">As Paula handed her pharmacist, Sarah, her new prescription, she asked if Sarah knew of an herbal remedy for high blood pressure. Sarah responded that what the physician had prescribed was a very effective treatment. She added that, with exercise and a proper diet, the chances were good that Paula would be able to get her blood pressure under control.</p>
<p class="indent">Paula decided to visit her faith healer and ask what herbal he would recommend. She did not want to increase her medication dosage, despite her physician&#8217;s advice.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Discussion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The physician in this case study, using a biomedical approach, focused on signs and symptoms. This approach may not account for psychosocial factors that can play a major role in our ailments. If the physician had used a different approach, he could have learned from the patient, who is the expert on her own condition. A narrative communication approach allows the patient to discuss her perceptions, concerns, attitudes, beliefs, and values regarding her health status. This approach alerts health care providers to misconceptions, errors, and misinformation held by patients, which the provider can then correct. In this approach, providers can construct treatment plans based on the patient&#8217;s own information about her illness, rather than on charts, profiles, or stereotypes. The narrative approach allows providers to build a treatment regimen <em>with</em> patients rather than prescribe a treatment regimen <em>for</em> patients. The distinction is critical, because patients are more likely to adhere to their treatment plans when their behaviors, opinions, needs, and values are taken into account.</p>
<p class="indent">Berlin and Fowkes<sup><a id="ch15-ref10" href="chapter15.xhtml#ch15_ref10">10</a></sup> have suggested using the L-E-A-R-N model of patient communication, as follows:</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>L</em>isten to the patient. In the preceding case study, neither the physician nor the pharmacist took time to listen. Pharmacists should listen to and understand patients&#8217; perceptions of their conditions. Ask open-ended questions. Elicit feedback from the patient. Let the patient tell his or her story. Sarah should have asked Paula some probing questions, such as <a id="page_208"/>&#8220;Are you interested in herbals because you&#8217;re concerned that medicine may not work?&#8221; &#8220;Why do you think your blood pressure is high?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>E</em>xplain your perception of the problem and your strategy for treatment. Often, strategies for treatment and the reasons for choosing them are not explained to the patient, or are explained in a way that is too technical. Pharmacists should make a concerted effort to explain the treatment and the decision-making process in a way that is easy for the patient to comprehend.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>A</em>cknowledge the patient&#8217;s perspective and discuss similarities to and differences from the health care provider&#8217;s perspective. The pharmacist&#8211;patient relationship should be collaborative, rather than prescriptive. The patient must be acknowledged and respected. In case study 3, both health care providers missed the opportunity to compare herbal remedies with the patient&#8217;s prescription drug. When patients are educated about their options, they can make better decisions regarding their health.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>R</em>ecommend treatment while remembering the patient&#8217;s cultural background. Do not force your own attitudes, beliefs, and values on the patient. Sarah needs to realize that many of her patients value alternative forms of medicine. Rather than dismissing or ignoring patients&#8217; beliefs about alternative medicine, pharmacists should take the opportunity to work with patients on a drug regimen that meets their specific needs.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>N</em>egotiate an agreement. Remember that the patient&#8217;s health is ultimately in the patient&#8217;s hands. Acknowledging the patient&#8217;s attitudes, beliefs, and values is essential in tailoring effective drug therapy. In case study 3, Paula never &#8220;bought into&#8221; the treatment prescribed for her; she ended up going to a faith healer. For any medication to work, pharmacists must partner with patients and elicit their cooperation and compliance.</p>
<p class="indentt">Sarah, from case study 3, admits that her first impulse would have been to dismiss seeing a faith healer as a total waste of time. She realizes that if she had used a narrative approach, rather than a biomedical approach, she would have learned valuable information about the patient that would have influenced the quality of care she provided. Sarah believes the narrative approach would have revealed (1) why the patient&#8217;s blood pressure was high, (2) that the patient had decided to reject the dosage increase, (3) that the patient valued nontraditional remedies, and (4) that simply listening to this patient would have been a therapeutic intervention. If Sarah had used this approach, Paula might not have gone to a faith healer.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_210"/>SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">The first step in becoming culturally competent is understanding that disparities and inequalities in health care exist for minority populations. The second step is understanding how our own cultural background affects the way we interpret, assign meaning to, and form value judgments about the beliefs and behaviors of others. Experiences influenced by race or ethnicity shape patients&#8217; perceptions of health care. They also affect patients&#8217; behavior, but not enough to account for the disparities that exist in the provision of care. The third step in becoming culturally competent is using communication strategies that improve the pharmacist&#8211;patient relationship and allow the development of treatment plans that avoid stereotypes and meet the individual patient&#8217;s needs regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, age, or economic status. Developing cultural competence is a lifelong process whose goal is improving the quality of care for all patients.</p>
