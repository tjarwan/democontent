<h2 class="h2a"><em>ASSERTIVENESS</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">Previous chapters have discussed listening and empathic responding and managing angry or difficult patients. Closely tied to listening, empathy, and managing angry patients is assertiveness. We must assert an empathic response. At times, we must also assert that we will not meet the unrealistic or inappropriate demands of others. For example, patients may ask pharmacists to provide a refill of a prescription that is not authorized. Without physician authorization, this demand cannot be met. Assertion involves standing up for personal rights and expressing thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in direct, honest, and appropriate ways that do not violate another person&#8217;s rights.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic message in assertion is, This is what I think, this is what I feel, this is how I see the situation. This message expresses who you are as a health professional and is said without dominating, humiliating, or degrading the other person.</p>
<p class="indent">Assertion involves respect, but not deference. Deference is acting in a subservient manner&#8212;as though the other person is right or better simply because the other person is older, more powerful, more experienced, or more knowledgeable or is of a different sex or race. Deference is present when people express themselves in ways that are self-effacing, appeasing, or overly apologetic.</p>
<h3 class="h3">RESPECT, ASSERTION, RIGHTS, AND BOUNDARIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">To understand assertiveness, it is necessary to first understand and accept that human beings have rights (see Your Assertiveness Rights at the end of this chapter). They have the right to be treated fairly. They have the right to be treated with respect. They have the right to be separate from others emotionally, psychologically, and physically. This last point is very important. Each human being is separate from others. Our thoughts and feelings do not have to be in concert with those of others, even those for whom we care deeply. We are not responsible for how others feel, nor are we responsible for their actions. We are only <a id="page_88"/>responsible for our own feelings and actions. Assertive people take responsibility for their thoughts, feelings, and actions. They respect others&#8217; rights and do not attempt to make others accountable for their own feelings and actions. Assertive people have clear boundaries. They are clear about who they are and how they feel. They are clear about when their rights are being violated. They are also clear that many of the &#8220;shoulds&#8221; that we learned as children don&#8217;t work very well for adults (they actually didn&#8217;t work very well for children either). The endless list of shoulds includes &#8220;don&#8217;t complain,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t be hurtful,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t question people and things,&#8221; and &#8220;always help others.&#8221; As adults, assertive people learn to question these shoulds or rules and decide what is best for themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Two types of respect are involved in assertiveness: respect for oneself, that is, expressing one&#8217;s needs and defending one&#8217;s rights, and respect for the other person. Your communication as a pharmacist can be nonassertive, aggressive, or assertive. With regard to respect, here is how the three modes of communication are different.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Nonassertive people don&#8217;t respect themselves.</strong> Nonassertive people may be dishonest, at times, because they don&#8217;t believe they have the right to express their own thoughts and feelings. They can be passive-aggressive or manipulative because of their lack of respect for their own rights. Ultimately, though, nonassertive behavior often encourages the inappropriate behavior of others, because such behavior is not challenged.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Aggressive people don&#8217;t respect others.</strong> They are willing to violate the rights of others in order to meet their own needs. They may be loud, interrupt others, and generally attempt to dominate conversations. They need to be right, and often they will not acknowledge the validity of differences in opinions, values, or ideas. Aggressive people often use blaming, criticism, sarcasm, threats, and name-calling in their communication with others.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Assertive people respect themselves and others.</strong> They are courageous. Assertive people use &#8220;I&#8221; statements (more on this later). They own their own feelings, thoughts, and ideas. They respect others, but they also expect to be respected. They are willing to openly and honestly communicate their feelings, opinions, and needs. They are also willing to communicate when they do not feel respected or they believe that boundaries have been violated. It is important to note that, even though assertive people believe in honest communication, they are also very aware that truth and wisdom are not the same thing. They realize that there are times when the truth may not be appropriate. An assertive person may not like the behavior of an aggressive boss but may not assert this because he or she has not yet found another job. An assertive <a id="page_89"/>pharmacist may realize that a patient he is dealing with is emotionally ill. He may have a very difficult time communicating in a calm, rational manner with this patient. Instead of saying to the patient, &#8220;You are too sick for me to deal with,&#8221; a better response might be, &#8220;I am having a very difficult time understanding what you need right now.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">MAKING &#8220;I&#8221; STATEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">A hallmark of practicing being assertive is making &#8220;I&#8221; statements. &#8220;I&#8221; statements cause us to take responsibility for our feelings, ideas, and needs. &#8220;I&#8221; statements often force us to &#8220;look inside&#8221; and decide what the issues are. Why are we upset with the other? What do we want to happen? What solutions are we willing to suggest? Again, making &#8220;I&#8221; statements means being responsible for oneself. It means coming to the realization that we cannot change other people&#8217;s behaviors. We can only change our response and communicate what we need. Caution is in order: Although this chapter strongly advocates assertive communication and &#8220;I&#8221; statements, the reader should not be fooled into believing that if people are assertive they will always get what they want and get their needs met. That is simply not true. It is not up to someone else to meet your needs. (If the other person is willing to do so, that is icing on the cake.) Obviously, the other person cannot do that if you don&#8217;t make your needs known. By being assertive, you are much more likely to be respected and taken seriously and to get more of what you want.</p>
<p class="indentt">It is important to use &#8220;I&#8221; statements to<sup><a id="ch7-ref1" href="chapter7.xhtml#ch7_ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Respond in a way that will de-escalate conflict,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Avoid using &#8220;you&#8221; statements that will escalate conflict,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Identify feelings,</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Identify behaviors that are causing the conflict, and</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Help individuals resolve the present conflict and prevent future conflicts.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a href="chapter7.xhtml#tab7.1">Table 7-1</a> gives examples of the appropriate use of &#8220;I&#8221; statements.</p>
<p class="indent">To communicate effectively during your consultations with patients, stay in an assertive mode. Present your views in a forthright and confident fashion. People do not usually have a high level of confidence in nonassertive speakers; conversely, they are frequently offended by aggression. There are several misconceptions about assertiveness. It is sometimes mistakenly said that assertive people tend to be rude, impolite, pushy, and uncaring. A truly assertive communicator is none of these. Look at the sidebar on page 91. Can you tell which mode of responding is being used in each situation?</p>

<h3 class="h3">TYPES OF ASSERTION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we review individual assertiveness skills, it is important to identify the types of assertive statements available to you. These types are</p>
<p class="blockquote-s"><strong>Simple assertion:</strong><br/>&#8220;I will be unable to refund your money on this item.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;I want you to take this four times a day, every day, until it is completely gone.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s"><strong>Empathic assertion:</strong><br/>&#8220;I know that this came as a complete surprise to you. There was no way to prepare for it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;I can tell that having to take three different medicines seems overwhelming to you right now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s"><strong>Confrontive assertion:</strong><br/>&#8220;You say you&#8217;re going to take your medication as we have discussed, but I&#8217;m not sure that you&#8217;re taking this seriously.&#8221;</p>
<div class="box-p">
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_91"/><strong>Situation 1</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Husband gets silent instead of saying what&#8217;s on his mind. Wife says, &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re uncomfortable talking about what&#8217;s bothering you. I think we can work that out if you tell me what&#8217;s irritating you.&#8221; Answer: Assertive.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Situation 2</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">You&#8217;d like a raise and say, &#8220;Do you think that, ah, you could see your way clear to giving me a raise?&#8221; Answer: Nonassertive.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Situation 3</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">You&#8217;ve been talking for a while with a friend on the telephone. You would like to end the conversation and you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry, but my supper&#8217;s burning and I have to get off the phone. I hope you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; Answer: Nonassertive&#8212;your supper is really not burning.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Situation 4</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">At a meeting, one person often interrupts you when you&#8217;re speaking. You calmly say, &#8220;Excuse me, I would like to finish my statement.&#8221; Answer: Assertive.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Situation 5</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">A blind person approaches and asks you to purchase something he&#8217;s selling. You respond, &#8220;You people think that just because you&#8217;re blind, people have to buy stuff from you. Well, I&#8217;m certainly not going to.&#8221; Answer: Aggressive.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Situation 6</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Man asks woman for a date. She has dated him once before and she is not interested in dating him again. She responds, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really so busy this week that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have time to see you Saturday night.&#8221; Answer: Nonassertive&#8212;this is not the honest reason.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Situation 7</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Wife gets silent instead of saying what&#8217;s on her mind. Husband says, &#8220;Here it comes, the big silent treatment. Would it kill you to spit it out just once?&#8221; Answer: Aggressive.</p>
</div>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;I can see that you&#8217;re a very busy person, but I really need to talk to you about your medication.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s"><strong>Negative feeling assertion:</strong><br/>&#8220;I feel really frustrated when I have trouble explaining to you how to properly take your medicine. You seem to feel that this is your wife&#8217;s responsibility more than your own. I <a id="page_92"/>would like to try again. When you do this, I feel like I really don&#8217;t want you to leave the pharmacy until I can hear some personal commitment from you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s"><strong>Positive feeling assertion:</strong><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;I really like it that you come in on the exact day you are scheduled for your refill.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">ASSERTIVENESS SKILLS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Each of the following skills, when used appropriately, can help you to interact with your patients assertively. These assertiveness skills are excerpted from the book <em>When I Say No, I Feel Guilty</em>.<sup><a id="ch7-ref2" href="chapter7.xhtml#ch7_ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Broken record.</strong> By using calm repetition&#8212;saying what you want over and over again&#8212;you can be persistent in your communication without having to rehearse arguments or angry feelings beforehand in order to be &#8220;up&#8221; for dealing with others.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;In my professional opinion, it is not advisable for you to drink alcohol while taking this medication.&#8221; (said repeatedly)</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;I cannot, in good conscience, fill this prescription as written.&#8221; (again, repeatedly)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Fogging.</strong> Accepting manipulative criticism by calmly acknowledging to your critic the probability that there may be some truth in what he or she says, yet remaining your own judge of what you do.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">Patient: &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid. Why should I have to take it three times a day with food?&#8221;<br/>Pharmacist: &#8220;I know this must sound confusing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">Patient: &#8220;You&#8217;re just a pharmacist. My doctor told me everything I need to know.&#8221;<br/>Pharmacist: &#8220;You&#8217;re right, I am a pharmacist. And I work with your doctor to make sure you know how to take your medicine properly.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Negative inquiry.</strong> Actively prompting criticism in order to use the information (if helpful) or exhaust it (if manipulative) while prompting your critic to be more assertive and less dependent on manipulative ploys.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s"><a id="page_93"/>Patient: &#8220;This is ridiculous. I can&#8217;t take this four times a day.&#8221; Pharmacist: &#8220;What is it about taking this medicine four times a day that bothers you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;What is it that you dislike about what I&#8217;ve just told you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Workable compromise.</strong> It is practical, whenever you feel that your self-respect is not in question, to offer a workable compromise to the other person. You can always bargain for your material goals unless the compromise affects your personal feelings of self-respect. If the end goal involves a matter of your self-worth, however, there can be no compromise.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;Since this is a medicine for pain, I would be able to dispense only half of your prescription.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Sorting issues.</strong> Occasionally, in the course of an interaction, several issues will become sandwiched together. Unless these issues or messages are sorted out and dealt with separately, the individual may begin to feel confused, anxious, and guilty. Consequently, it is to the assertive individual&#8217;s and the recipient&#8217;s advantage to deal with these different issues separately.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">Patient: &#8220;I thought you were my friend. Why didn&#8217;t you tell me my daughter was taking birth control pills?&#8221; Pharmacist: &#8220;I am your friend, but I&#8217;m also a pharmacist. I need to discuss this issue with you as your pharmacist. And as a pharmacist, I owe your daughter confidentiality.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">Patient: &#8220;I came all the way down here to get this filled, and now you tell me I&#8217;m too early for a refill. I do a lot of business here, you know.&#8221;<br/>Pharmacist: &#8220;I am grateful that you do so much business in this pharmacy. However, it is too early for this prescription to be refilled.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Disarming anger.</strong> Disarming anger can be an extremely useful protective technique. This technique involves an honest contract offered to another individual who is exhibiting a lot of anger and who may, in fact, be bordering on physical violence. The goal is an agreement that you will talk about whatever issue the other person wants, but only after some of the anger dissipates. Writing down an angry person&#8217;s comments will often help to defuse the anger. It also serves <a id="page_94"/>the purpose of slowing the angry person down, because you cannot write as fast as he or she can yell. Further, when a record is being kept, a person will often choose words more cautiously.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;I am very interested in helping you with this problem. However, I get very nervous when people yell at me, and I am going to need you to talk in a normal voice to me before I can do anything for you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">&#8220;Oh! I didn&#8217;t realize that a mistake could have been made. Let me get a pen and paper. I want to get all the details down about this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Selective ignoring.</strong> Selective ignoring is discriminatory attending or nonattending to specific content from another individual. That is, replies are not given to unfair or abusive interaction, but only to statements that are not destructive, guilt-producing, prejudicial, or unjust.</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">Patient: &#8220;Hey, honey, ya got my prescription ready?&#8221;<br/>Pharmacist: (matter-of-factly and without response to the sexist remark) &#8220;Let me check on that, Mr. Johnson.&#8221;</p>
<p class="blockquote-s">Patient: &#8220;These directions sure are confusing. Why don&#8217;t you come over to my place and explain them to me?&#8221; Pharmacist: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to explain them to you here. What confuses you?&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">YOUR ASSERTIVENESS RIGHTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Becoming more assertive takes practice. It also takes committing yourself to knowing, understanding, and practicing your assertiveness rights. These rights are<sup><a href="chapter7.xhtml#ch7_ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to judge your own behavior, thoughts, and emotions, and to take upon yourself the responsibility for their initiation and any consequences.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to offer no reasons or excuses to justify your behavior.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to judge whether you are responsible for finding solutions to other people&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to change your mind</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to make mistakes&#8212;and be responsible for them.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to be independent of the goodwill of others before coping with them.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><a id="page_95"/><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to be illogical in making decisions.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to say no without feeling guilty.</p>
<h3 class="h3">SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">When you don&#8217;t believe you have these rights, your communication will most likely be nonassertive or aggressive. Being assertive won&#8217;t always get you what you want or change others&#8217; inappropriate ways of responding, but you will feel better about yourself.</p>
