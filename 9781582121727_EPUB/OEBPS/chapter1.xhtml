<h2 class="h2a"><em>CARING, COVENANTS, CODES, AND<br/>COMMITMENT</em></h2>
<p class="noindent">We are facing massive change in health care in general and pharmacy in particular. The pharmacy profession is changing much more rapidly now than it was 5 years ago, yet many pharmacists are still fighting change rather than embracing it. Many in the profession are looking for someone to blame rather than deciding how to move forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacy has responded to changes in the health care system in part by making pharmaceutical care its mission. Pharmaceutical care requires completely rethinking the way pharmacists have traditionally practiced. Some pharmacists confuse it with patient counseling or disease management, but pharmaceutical care is far more complex and offers many more challenges.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmaceutical care requires that pharmacists take responsibility for preventing and solving drug-related problems and optimizing drug therapy. This means that real and potential problems must be identified and solved by talking to and working with patients and other health care providers. This does not end when the patient leaves the pharmacy. Assessing, monitoring, documenting care and progress, and follow-up care are integral parts of providing pharmaceutical care. And assessing means not just physical assessment of the patient but assessment of the patient&#8217;s understanding of the illness and the treatment plan. Pharmaceutical care also means involving the patient throughout the process.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, pharmaceutical care requires marketing and management support. No doubt, there is a market need for pharmaceutical care, but there is not yet a clear market demand. Patients don&#8217;t know they need it, physicians aren&#8217;t sure what it is or if they should like it, and payers don&#8217;t understand it or aren&#8217;t convinced that it will really reduce health care costs. As I&#8217;ve traveled throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia discussing pharmaceutical care with pharmacists, I&#8217;ve heard a common theme. Most pharmacists <em>are</em> convinced that we must make the transition to pharmaceutical care for the sake of our <a id="page_2"/>patients and our profession. Most also agree that there is a market need but not a market demand. But few see it as their job to create this demand&#8212;to &#8220;sell&#8221; pharmaceutical care and the mission of pharmacy. We are waiting for someone else to sell our mission. But only pharmacists really care about pharmacy, so it is up to every pharmacist to market pharmaceutical care. And we need to start now.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter provides observations about the profession of pharmacy, the problems it faces, and some solutions for a productive and exciting future. I don&#8217;t want to sound pessimistic, but I don&#8217;t believe many in the profession will survive without embracing the changes we face. Dispensing drugs alone won&#8217;t cut it. The health care system has sent a clear message to pharmacy that simply dispensing drugs has very little value. In fact, drugs dispensed without proper education and involvement substantially raise health care costs. We don&#8217;t need more studies to prove this last point. The only real argument is whether we are talking about $75 billion, $100 billion, or $150 billion in health care costs resulting from drug-related morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p class="indent">The health care system has also told us quite clearly that it won&#8217;t pay for anything that doesn&#8217;t lower costs or improve outcomes. Yet many pharmacists continue to cling to dispensing, even as fees and reimbursement for drug costs shrink. Some argue that they have no time to do anything but dispense drugs and that, furthermore, they don&#8217;t get paid to do anything else. But they cannot afford to <em>not</em> make the time, and why would people pay for services they are not yet getting? I am certainly not saying that pharmacists should give up control of dispensing. I am simply saying that we must be more involved in the care of the patient.</p>
<h3 class="h3">RETHINKING OUR STANDARD OF CARE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some time ago I went to a pharmacy with a new prescription. The pharmacist was alone and the pharmacy was not busy. The pharmacist filled my prescription, attached an information leaflet to the stapled bag, and collected my copayment. Then he held out a clipboard with a pad of two-column, lined paper on it, pointed to the right-hand column of the pad, and said, &#8220;Sign here,&#8221; pointing to the line below several previous signatures. I asked to see the clipboard, and as I looked through the pages I noticed that all the previous signatures were in the right-hand column. In small print at the top of that column was the statement &#8220;I do not want counseling,&#8221; and, at the top of the left-hand column, &#8220;I want counseling.&#8221; I was never asked whether I wanted counseling or if I had any questions before I was instructed to &#8220;Sign here.&#8221; I never received any verbal (spoken) counseling. I looked at the pharmacist and said, &#8220;What you are doing is illegal. But worse than that, it is immoral and <a id="page_3"/>unethical. You have asked me to sign a waiver of my right to informed consent without informing me of what I am giving up, all so that you don&#8217;t have to verbally offer to counsel me about my medicine. I am going to report you to the state board.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">The pharmacist was aghast as he looked at me and said, &#8220;Why? What are you talking about? It&#8217;s not my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Whose fault is it?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, &#8220;My district manager wants us to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">I looked at him and said, &#8220;This is truly sad. Your obligation is to me, not to your district manager. You are here to serve the public&#8212;to protect me. You are licensed by privilege, not by right. Whenever we allow others to dictate our standards, we, in a very real sense, lose our profession.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">As I walked away, he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot say for certain that I would be different if I were practicing pharmacy. I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident in pharmacy. It was not. I felt obligated to report this pharmacist because of my own professional duty. It <em>is</em> my obligation to police my own profession. Pharmacists have an obligation to report this kind of behavior. It not only puts the public at risk, it hurts all of us professionally.</p>
<p class="indent">In times of chaotic change, like that occurring in pharmacy, people and organizations may behave in ways and make decisions that are not consistent with how they would behave under less stressful conditions&#8212;sometimes at the expense of the clients they are supposed to serve and protect. When faced with the problems created by chaotic change, people respond in one of three ways: they &#8220;go numb,&#8221; blame someone else, or solve the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">The pharmacist I encountered was ready to blame someone else. He clearly did not understand what it meant to be a professional, to care about me as the patient more than about the employer who was asking him to put people at risk. It is easy to blame the employer, but the real problem lies with the pharmacist. Granted, it would take great courage to stand up as a professional and say, &#8220;In good conscience, I cannot ask patients to sign this. I won&#8217;t do it.&#8221; But that is exactly what we need to do: to say that <em>we</em> control our profession&#8217;s standards, not anyone else. Because pharmacists are in short supply, we have the leverage to say, &#8220;Keep your signing bonuses and car leases. I want 8 to 16 hours of uninterrupted time each week to schedule patient care.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT OUR PATIENTS?</h3>
<p class="noindent">What has happened to the pharmacy profession? How did we get here? We have lost sight of what is truly important: the patient. We are licensed by privilege to make sure that the drugs patients receive are appropriate for each individual patient. That means we need to know <a id="page_4"/>something about our patients. What does the patient know and understand about the illness and its treatment? Does the patient believe the diagnosis? What&#8217;s a typical day like for the patient? To what extent do patients intend to take responsibility for their illnesses? Do they understand what they have been told and the choices available to them?</p>
<p class="indent">When we practice pharmacy, are we able to answer these questions? If the answer is no, then why <em>don&#8217;t</em> we know these things? We say that pharmaceutical care is our mission, but is it our standard? Can people expect to receive pharmaceutical care in every pharmacy where they present a prescription or when they need information about treating an illness? What can the profession promise and deliver in every pharmacy in the United States? Are we, collectively, delivering more than just the drug the physician ordered? The answer is no. Why, then, do we expect to get paid for more when our national standard is to only dispense the drug? Clearly, some pharmacists are delivering more, but they are not in the majority.</p>
<p class="indent">Are we behaving morally and ethically as a profession? When patients do not receive important information about their medication, and when we do not assess their understanding of the illness and treatment, we are putting them at risk. When we ask patients to sign a waiver of their right to counseling, to circumvent the intent of OBRA &#8217;90,<sup><a id="ch1-fn1" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_fn1">a</a></sup> we are depriving them of their right to informed consent&#8212;their right to make informed decisions about the medications they are about to take (or not take). Again, we are putting them at risk. We say we don&#8217;t have time and we aren&#8217;t paid for this (and because many other pharmacies do the same, it must be all right), but none of these reasons make it right.</p>
<h3 class="h3">CARING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pharmaceutical care requires the development of a covenantal relationship with our patients. It requires that we care and provide care. The first principle of the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) Code of Ethics states, &#8220;A pharmacist respects the covenantal relationship between the patient and pharmacist.&#8221; What does this mean? Why is it important? What is caring? What are covenantal relationships? What do these concepts have to do with our code of ethics and the need for our profession to commit itself to these concepts?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_5"/>Pharmaceutical care is &#8220;the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient&#8217;s quality of life.&#8221;<sup><a id="ch1-ref1" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref1">1</a></sup> According to Hepler and Strand,<sup><a href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref1">1</a></sup> &#8220;There are four criteria to be considered before pharmacists should be granted authority or pharmacists should accept responsibility for providing pharmaceutical care: (i) the provider must possess knowledge and skill in pharmaceutics and clinical pharmacology; (ii) the provider must be able to mobilize the drug distribution system by which drug use decisions are implemented; (iii) the provider must be able to develop the relationships with the patient and other health care professionals needed to provide pharmaceutical care; and (iv) as a practical matter, the provider must be available in society in sufficient numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmaceutical care requires a much more intimate and intensive relationship between the pharmacist and patient. Information must be provided and understood by both the patient and the pharmacist. Problems the patient has now or has had with medications must be explored in a manner that is nonjudgmental and nonthreatening. Appropriate medication regimens must be tailored to the needs of the individual patient, not the needs of the provider. Concerns that patients have about their illness or treatment must be addressed in a way that legitimizes, not minimizes, the concerns. That is, pharmaceutical care requires caring. But what does caring mean?</p>
<p class="indent">At the most basic level, caring means attending to the needs of others&#8212;making the concern of others paramount:<sup><a id="ch1-ref2" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="blockquote">When we have genuinely received another, we often feel our motive energy flowing toward the needs and projects of the other. We want to help&#8212;to relieve pain, to achieve a goal that is not our own, to actualize a dream. This is a feeling that all carers experience when they are in an authentic caring mode. The self is still there with all its own ideals, loves, and projects, but its energy is temporarily put into the service of the other&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p class="indentt">Carl Rogers<sup><a id="ch1-ref3" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref3">3</a></sup> would call this unconditional positive regard. This is the willingness to be loving and accepting of the patient. When pharmacists make themselves available to patients, they relieve some of their patients&#8217; sense of fear and loneliness. This is the work of empathic understanding. The questions the pharmacist must ask are, &#8220;Can I permit myself to enter into the private world of my patients, explore their feelings without judging them, and, in some significant and honest way, respond in a manner that lets them know that I have listened and I want to provide whatever assistance or comfort that I can? Can I see this person as having a unique reaction to his or her illness? Can I <a id="page_6"/>learn enough about this person so that the insight or assistance I give is likely to be useful?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Reich<sup><a id="ch1-ref4" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref4">4</a></sup> stated that &#8220;care means worry or concern.&#8230;The significance of this meaning of care is that if nothing matters, if nothing is worth worrying about, ethics is not possible. Any attempt to develop a systematic inquiry into the moral life would be bogged down, for the moral life itself would be mired in apathy.&#8221; What Reich is saying is that only when I care about something or someone do I transcend my own self-oriented desires and develop morality. In fact, this is one of the first lessons we try to teach children: to care about others, to see and be concerned about the impact of what they do and how the choices they make affect others.</p>
<p class="indent">Ethics and morality depend on caring about the welfare of others. In fact, ethical decision-making involves identifying which issues (of many) are the most salient or important for my attention and concern. What merits my moral caring or concern? For example, pharmacists may say they do not have time (or do not get paid) to render pharmaceutical care. If a patient came to your pharmacy and you knew that the drug prescribed would kill the patient, given the patient&#8217;s prior medical history, would you intervene despite how busy you were and whether you got paid? I hope so. What if the medication would &#8220;only&#8221; blind the patient? Would you still intervene despite time and money? Again, I hope so. What if the medication would cause explosive diarrhea that would hospitalize the patient within 3 days? Less certain about intervening? I hope not. The point is that we must decide what caring behavior is. What are the most salient issues here? Time? Money? The degree of risk the patient will assume? Why do we think we have the right to decide the extent to which the patient will be at risk or how much harm is sufficient to intervene? These are issues of care and concern for the value of human life. Becoming a professional, by definition, means that what we do is not solely motivated by financial gain. In fact, the primary motivation is service to the public. You might say that this is altruistic. I would argue that the foundation for professional behavior <em>is</em> altruism.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PROFESSIONALISM</h3>
<p class="noindent">What are the characteristics of a professional? How would we recognize one if we saw one? Consider the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Expertise.</strong> This results from prolonged and intensive specialized training. It is unique expertise that allows the professional the power to make decisions about the client. The client grants this authority to the professional because of the unique expertise. The client also assumes <a id="page_7"/>that the professional will use this power to serve the client, not the needs of the professional.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Autonomy.</strong> This involves self-control over decisions and work activities, motivated by doing what is right for the client. It also involves a commitment to providing clients sufficient information so that they can make better decisions about their own well-being. But it does not stop with simply providing information. There is an advocacy role here, one of patient empowerment. Patient advocacy involves more than giving patients information in order to satisfy their right to informed consent or autonomy. Advocacy is more than giving patients what they want. Giving a patient information without assessing the patient&#8217;s understanding of that information is a form of paternalism, in which the health care provider decides what is enough. Moreover, health care providers should not leave patients alone in decisions about managing their health, believing that giving patients information is all that the job requires. We cannot leave it to the patient to sort through a maze of information and decide what is best. This simply won&#8217;t work, and it is not true advocacy and does not promote empowerment.</p>
<p class="indent">So what is true advocacy? Existential advocacy, according to Gadow,<sup><a id="ch1-ref5" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref5">5</a></sup> involves &#8220;participation with the patient in determining the unique meaning which the experience of health, illness, suffering, or dying is to have for that individual.&#8221; Gadow elaborates:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The ideal which existential advocacy expresses is this: that individuals be <em>assisted</em>&#8230;to <em>authentically</em> exercise their freedom of self-determination. By authentic is meant a way of reaching decisions which are truly one&#8217;s own&#8212;decisions that express all that one believes important about oneself and the world, the entire complexity of one&#8217;s values.</p>
<p class="indentt">To do this, patients must not only be informed about their illnesses and treatment options, but they must also be given ample opportunity to express their understanding, beliefs, and values about the illness and treatment options. They must be given the time and encouragement to ask questions, raise concerns, and express feelings about what is happening to them. The health care provider does not leave patients in isolation to decide on their own. The health care provider can help by expressing what he or she thinks is advisable, but ultimately all decisions must be up to the patient. This kind of advocacy values the patient&#8217;s right to self-determination above all other human rights; it is essential to patient empowerment.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Identification with the profession.</strong> Professionals take pride in their profession. They want the profession to thrive, not merely survive. <a id="page_8"/>They hold the profession to high standards and attempt to raise the standards of the profession.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Commitment to a calling.</strong> Professionals are committed to their careers and to lifelong learning. They are committed to staying current because they know this is necessary in order to serve patients and maintain the expertise that allowed patients to entrust them with power in the first place.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Ethics.</strong> Professions have internal codes of ethics. Why? Because the public is not in a position to determine whether professional standards are being met. Codes are a written and public commitment to serve and protect the public as consistent with the expertise of the professional. But no profession should develop a code of ethics without input from the public the profession serves. Failure to seek such input would indicate that the profession presumes to know what is best for the public&#8212;to know this better than the public itself. This is simply another form of paternalism. Why would a professional with expertise in pharmacotherapy presume to know what is best for a patient&#8217;s life (e.g., for the patient&#8217;s family life and daily routines)? The expertise does not qualify the professional to know that.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Collegial maintenance of standards.</strong> This means that professionals are committed to policing themselves. Again, because the general public often does not know if standards are being met, professionals must police themselves in order to make good on their promise to serve and protect the public. For example, many patients do not know or understand what OBRA &#8217;90 requires of the pharmacy or pharmacist. Some pharmacists are asking patients to waive their right to counseling but not informing them about what they are waiving. This has the potential to harm patients. It certainly does not serve them. Pharmacists who know this is going on are obligated to report it to protect patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Professionalism implies the use of expertise to serve the public need:<sup><a id="ch1-ref6" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="blockquote">Professionals develop a public and moral responsibility to others by internalizing a clear sense of purpose, a strong commitment to serve the public, and a deep understanding of the ethic of the profession. This professional responsibility is reflected in the way professionals behave toward their clients and toward each other.</p>
<p class="indentt">This is why professional decisions must not be tempered by time or money. That is, pharmacists cannot use &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t get paid&#8221; as an excuse for neglecting basic duties to the patient. I am fully in favor of professionals being paid for their expertise. Their expertise is the capital they have to sell. I am simply saying that to truly be a professional mandates that one <em>not require</em> payment to provide <a id="page_9"/>needed services. This is altruism and is part of the definition of a professional. This is a risk we are willing to take to become a professional.</p>
<h3 class="h3">COVENANTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Recall that pharmaceutical care requires the development of a covenantal relationship with our patients. What does this mean? A covenant is a promise. It is a gift. It is something owed. What do we owe patients? We owe them our expertise. We owe them sufficient time and energy to allow them to understand their illness and its treatment and to ask questions about those things and choices they don&#8217;t understand or are unclear about. We owe them current information and the highest quality standards we can provide. We owe it to them to ask ourselves, &#8220;How would God (or whoever your purveyor of truth is) practice pharmacy?&#8221; and &#8220;Would God (or your purveyor of truth) practice pharmacy the way I am practicing it?&#8221; If the answer to either question indicates that we are far from where we need to be, let us not beat ourselves up. Let us begin the work of figuring out how to get where we know we should be, no matter how difficult the task, no matter how many roadblocks are thrown in front of us, because it is simply the right thing to do. More on this later.</p>
<p class="indent">In her courageous talk at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists leadership conference in 1999, Kathleen Marie Dixon<sup><a id="ch1-ref7" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref7">7</a></sup> called upon pharmacists to take up the torch of virtue theory and ethics. She reminded us that the ethicist Philippa Foot said, &#8220;For sometimes one man succeeds where another fails not because there is some specific difference in their previous conduct but because his heart lies in a different place; and the disposition of the heart is part of virtue.&#8221; Dixon went on to say that virtue theory helps us to re-engage our hearts in both our work and our selves. She referred to</p>
<p class="blockquote">a spark of passion, perhaps not for the discipline as it is practiced today, but for what it <em>can be</em>. That perception of excellence, that insight into virtue, grounds this paradigm. That spark can pass quickly between human beings, creating interest in and desire for personal development, revealing new patterns of thought and experience. This in turn becomes the engine that drives professional change.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>CODES</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">In 1994 the profession of pharmacy, spearheaded by APhA and encouraged by the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners, put forth a new and dramatically different Code of Ethics. The Code is based on the concept of pharmaceutical care as developed by Hepler and Strand.<sup><a href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref1">1</a></sup> It requires a level of professional practice that carries with it far more responsibilities, yet far more autonomy. Votterro<sup><a id="ch1-ref8" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref8">8</a></sup> commented that &#8220;Pharmacists who respond to this additional level of professional practice and autonomy and embrace the unique <em>caring</em> expectations of this new practice mode will be further challenged to demonstrate group and personal behavior that may be far beyond the present expectations of society.&#8221; The preamble and eight principles of the Code of Ethics for Pharmacists appear above, and the full text of the Code<sup><a id="ch1-ref9" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref9">9</a></sup> is available at <a href="http://www.pharmacist.com">www.pharmacist.com</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"/>Look at the first principle: &#8220;A pharmacist respects the covenantal relationship between the patient and pharmacist.&#8221; There is that covenant thing again. Are we serious about this? This is a profoundly important statement. What it requires of the pharmacist is serious business. It requires a commitment on the part of the pharmacist to virtues and existential advocacy. Are we ready? Are we to have a Code in name only&#8212;something that is nice but that we really don&#8217;t intend to do&#8212;or is it time to seriously challenge ourselves and ask, How do we get there? How do we make our Code live? If we are not ready, what steps are needed to get us there?</p>
<h3 class="h3">STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">To move forward, we must look at standards. What is pharmacy&#8217;s standard? What can we promise patients when they walk into a pharmacy to get a prescription filled? Do pharmacists provide verbal counseling for each patient with a new prescription? Do pharmacists provide all patients with written medication information? In both cases, the answer is no. What we generally <em>do</em> provide for each patient is the medication ordered by the physician. We are very good at dispensing exactly what is written on the prescription. Unfortunately, what the physician orders is not always appropriate for the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">There <em>are</em> many pharmacists who counsel each patient and not only question the appropriateness of the drug therapy prescribed but also act on the behalf of patients to change the drug therapy when necessary. However, for this to be a standard, it must be done each time, by all pharmacists. That is what a standard of practice is. Why are we surprised that we get paid (and often not well) only for dispensing drugs, when that is our standard? Pharmacists who have raised their standard are getting paid for more than just dispensing.</p>
<p class="indent">So, how do we develop standards? One way is to look at what we know. What does research tell us about what must happen to produce positive drug therapy outcomes? We know that in order to achieve optimal outcomes from their drug therapy, patients must</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Understand the diagnosis.</strong> Do patients understand the diagnosis and treatment? Do they know what they need to do? Do they believe they can do it?</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Be interested in their health.</strong> Do patients care whether or not they get healthier, and do they want to prevent illness?</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Correctly assess the potential impact of the diagnosis.</strong> Do patients understand what will happen if they do or do not treat the illness appropriately?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_12"/><strong>Believe in the efficacy of the prescribed treatment.</strong> Do patients believe that the medication will have the intended effect? Do they understand what the medication actually does and how they will know whether it is working?</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Find ways of using the medication that are not more trouble than the disease.</strong> Some illnesses &#8220;feel&#8221; better than the treatment. For example, patients with high blood pressure often initially feel worse when they are put on medication. Do they understand that this may happen? Do they know that this is usually transient? Do they know what to do if this condition does not change after a specified period of time? Do patients know how long it should take for the medicine to have its intended effect, what the effect is, and how to measure it, if necessary (e.g., by measuring blood pressure or peak flow)?</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Be assessed regarding their readiness.</strong> Substantial literature supports variation among patients in readiness to manage their illnesses and the self-management behaviors necessary to manage the illness. Different strategies are necessary for different stages of readiness. Are patients being properly assessed so that appropriate interventions are used?</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who meet these criteria are likely to adhere to (comply with) their medication regimens. Therefore, if pharmacists are to have a substantive impact on health outcomes in patients, our standards of practice must include ways of addressing these issues. The way we communicate information to patients is part of our standards. For example, how do we tell patients what &#8220;1 bid&#8221; means? Do we tell them that this means approximately 12 hours apart and then tailor the dosing times to their daily routine, or do we tell them to take the medicine twice a day and hope they figure out what we mean? What does &#8220;1 pc and hs&#8221; mean? What does it mean for a patient with diabetes who eats six small meals a day? Do we really want him taking the medicine seven times a day? <em>How</em> we communicate information should be part of our standards, because it affects treatment outcomes.</p>
<h3 class="h3">MAKING THE TRANSITION: SOME ASSUMPTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before going any further, it is important to state some underlying assumptions:</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Pharmaceutical care is the mission of pharmacy practice. It involves optimizing health outcomes through the appropriate use of pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a market need for pharmaceutical care. Pharmacists must create the demand.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Most <a id="page_13"/>pharmacists want to provide pharmaceutical care. Many have a hard time imagining how to do so in an environment that has focused on dispensing drugs.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Providing pharmaceutical care will lower health care costs in total (or at the very least, raise quality without increasing the total costs of care).</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Great courage is needed by all pharmacists in all work settings to demand that our professional standardss not be compromised. What is courage? It is the will to look for right answers. According to Dixon,<sup><a href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref7">7</a></sup> &#8220;What brings the right answer is an exercise of justice and realism and really looking. The difficulty is to keep the attention fixed upon the real situation and to prevent focusing on our own needs or defenses.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Pharmacists need not fear that they will lose their jobs for upholding the law or raising standards.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;We must stop blaming others for our problems. When people are placed in extraordinary or difficult situations in which they must choose that which is good, right, or moral versus that which is expedient, great courage is needed. Otherwise they must become numb or blame someone or something else in order to escape the pain of giving up what they know is right. Pharmacists, for far too long now, have been placed in those very difficult situations in which they must choose, and too often they have chosen what is expedient. To be courageous is very frightening and often painfully lonely. However, doing what we know at our core is just not right hurts our very souls. That is a much higher price to pay, and it is time for it to stop.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;We must stop believing that anyone other than pharmacists is interested in our survival as a profession.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The transition will require a concerted effort from many different groups, including pharmacists, schools of pharmacy and their faculty members, pharmacy students, state boards of pharmacy, providers of continuing professional education, and our state and national professional associations.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT PHARMACISTS CAN DO</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let&#8217;s start with what pharmacists need to do. First, we must realize that whenever members of a profession allow others to dictate their practice standards, they, in a very real sense, cease to be a profession. Pharmacists must be willing to do the courageous work of standing up <a id="page_14"/>and saying that something is terribly wrong when their professional ethics and morals are compromised. What would this mean? It would mean actively counseling patients regardless of how busy you are. It would mean that patients would, at minimum, be assessed to ensure that the medication prescribed is right for them and to make sure they understand their illness and its treatment, and that they would have their questions or concerns addressed (or an appointment would be made to do so).</p>
<p class="indent">Impossible, you say. Patients would get backed up. Patients would find another pharmacy to go to because they wouldn&#8217;t want to wait. Many would call corporate offices complaining about the long waits. You could get fired. Or, for the first time, patients would see how valuable the pharmacist is and would be willing to wait for and pay for this value (we know that patients consistently say they want and value this from the pharmacist).</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients would leave and go where it&#8217;s cheap and fast. Some would call corporate offices and complain. What are we afraid of? Do we really believe that someone is going to fire a pharmacist for raising or upholding standards? If a pharmacist did get fired for this, I think the pharmacist would have a case to successfully sue the organization.</p>
<p class="indent">Best of all, <em>we</em>, not some external body, would be setting our standards. The danger is, of course, that few would be brave enough to do this. But what a day this would be! Jesse Vivian, a pharmacist and attorney, has said he would welcome the opportunity to defend any pharmacist who is fired for upholding or raising standards.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Start small.</strong> I challenge you to identify one patient in your pharmacy each month for whom you will provide a high level of care. It could be a patient with asthma or diabetes that is not well controlled. It may require coming in 20 minutes early for your shift or staying 20 minutes late (or whatever it takes). Document the care you provide and, with the patient&#8217;s permission, provide the documentation to the patient&#8217;s primary care physician, the patient, the patient&#8217;s employer, and the patient&#8217;s third-party payer, and send the payer an invoice for your services. The patient&#8217;s physician needs to know there is a pharmacy in town where this level of care is provided. This could be a great source of referrals.</p>
<p class="indent">Promote this service when you are ready. The message to general practitioners (GPs) and family practitioners (FPs) should be, &#8220;If we work together to keep Mrs. X&#8217;s diabetes [for example] under control, you get to keep the patient.&#8221; In other words, the GP or FP doesn&#8217;t lose the patient to a specialist, such as an endocrinologist or pulmonologist. Moreover, many pharmacists report that they have now engaged physicians in writing prescriptions for care. For example, the physician writes an order for diabetes education and monitoring. This order is attached <a id="page_15"/>to the documentation and to the invoice sent to the third-party payer as justification for the service.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient should get a copy of the documentation so he or she is aware of what you have done. The employer should get a copy because, ultimately, employers pay for health care in the United States. Furthermore, this speaks volumes about the level of care a local pharmacist can provide, and employers can use this information in deciding whether to use local pharmacies or a mail-order service.</p>
<p class="indent">Think about this. There are approximately 150,000 practicing pharmacists in the United States. If, once each month, only one-third of those pharmacists submitted documentation for compensation for services rendered to a single patient with a chronic illness, the profession collectively would provide third parties with over 50,000 pieces of evidence that this is not an isolated way of practicing. Our standard would be raised, and the profession would be in a much better position to negotiate compensation for patient care services. Initially, would everyone get paid? Probably not. Would someone? Some already are. To see who some of them are, go to the Auburn University Harrison School of Pharmacy Web site and choose a category from the &#8220;innovation menu&#8221; (<a href="http://pharmacy.auburn.edu/pcs/innovat/innovat.htm">http://pharmacy.auburn.edu/pcs/innovat/innovat.htm</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Every successful innovative practitioner started by changing his or her practice with a single patient. And successful innovators will all tell you the same thing: It is not the money that now keeps them going. It is their own sense that what they are doing is valuable and meaningful to the patients they are serving. They go home knowing they have helped someone.</p>
<p class="indent">What should you do if you <em>are</em> paid? Don&#8217;t keep it to yourself. Tell us at Auburn or at APhA, and we will put you on our Web site. Write up your success story for your local or state pharmacy journal or newsletter, and share what you have learned so that others can follow your example.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are an employee pharmacist in a corporate pharmacy, ask your district manager for permission to identify a patient or a handful of patients with whom you can work more intensively as a pilot project. You may have to donate some of your time at first. But let the corporation know that if there is compensation by the patient or a third party, you want to share the rewards, through either higher compensation or more help (e.g., people, technology), so that you can expand what you are doing.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Develop a patient promise.</strong> Years ago, Folgers sold millions of dollars worth of coffee by telling consumers that Folgers was &#8220;mountain grown.&#8221; Of course, this was the truth, but it was also true for every other quality coffee on the market. Folgers simply took a fact about <a id="page_16"/>coffee and paired it with the attribute of quality to get consumers to believe that mountain-grown Folgers was best. It worked.</p>
<p class="indent">What does this have to do with pharmacy? There are so many things you do on a daily basis for your patients that you take for granted. Your patients often do not appreciate these things because they simply don&#8217;t know about them. For example, do you make sure the drug dispensed is not outdated? That it is the right quantity and strength? That it will not cause problems with any other medications or illnesses the patient may have? Do you provide a set of information (verbally or otherwise) to the patient with each new prescription dispensed that contains the name of the drug, strength, directions for use, precautions, major side effects, and so on?</p>
<p class="indent">To develop a patient promise, make a list on your pharmacy&#8217;s letterhead of everything you do or provide for patients each time they get a prescription filled in your pharmacy. Include all of the things I have already listed and anything else you do each time. Do not promise things you don&#8217;t do each time. Also list additional services that are available upon request. Whenever a patient gets a new prescription filled, hand the patient your sheet and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what other pharmacies in town do, but this is what I will do for you each time you get a new prescription filled here. [Remember &#8216;mountain grown.&#8217;] If you have any questions, please let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Create a demand for needed services.</strong> How do you do this? The next time a patient walks in with a new prescription for high blood pressure, for example, look at the patient and say,</p>
<p class="blockquote"><img src="images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/> Mr. Smith, you have high blood pressure. I want to make sure that this medicine lowers your blood pressure to the point where you are not at risk for a stroke or a heart attack. The only way we can know that your medicine is really working is to monitor your blood pressure. You simply can&#8217;t feel when your blood pressure is up or down. You will see your doctor only every 3 to 6 months, and I don&#8217;t want to wait that long to be sure that your medicine is working properly for you. I can offer you blood pressure monitoring equipment and teach you how to use it; I sell several types. Or, I have a blood pressure monitoring service for which I charge $X per month. You would come in as often as you would like, but at least once a week, and I would keep track of your blood pressure and send your doctor your readings every 2 weeks so we can work together to keep you as healthy as possible. Which do you prefer?</p>
<p class="indentt">What&#8217;s the worst the patient can say? &#8220;I don&#8217;t want either.&#8221; At least you would have offered a needed service and expressed your caring <a id="page_17"/>and concern. This would take all of 45 seconds. The same could be done with asthma and peak flow meters or diabetes monitoring if allowed in your state. Develop a herbal remedy consultation service. If people are willing to spend hundreds of dollars in a health food store, are they willing to pay to have you assess their nutritional and nutraceuticals needs in a systematic, scientific way? And who better to do this than a pharmacist? What do you have to lose?</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Re-evaluate your practice.</strong> This means everything: the physical environment, the workflow, technology, products sold, who does what, and so on. Are you performing tasks a technician can do? Do you sell products or services that have nothing to do with health care and may, in fact, be contrary to good health (e.g., tobacco products, beer, wine)? What messages are you sending to consumers about the business you are in? What do your patients want and need? When is the last time you asked them? What do physicians in your area need and want? Have you done any physician detailing to promote new services in collaboration with a physician? Have you discussed services you would like to provide with physicians in your area? Have you asked them what services they need? Have you tried speaking at a local medical association meeting? Have you tried speaking at a local PTA meeting about such things as seasonal services?</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Think outside the box.</strong> Don&#8217;t limit your practice or what you do to a physical site. This includes counseling and other services. If the service is needed, take the mountain to Muhammad: Make house calls. Make telephone calls. Counseling can be done by phone. Learn to think creatively about what patients want and how to provide it. Have you gotten involved in e-business? Do you have a Web presence? What do you use it for? Do your patients know about it? How can it help them? Are you brick-and-click or brick or click only? Do you know what this means? If not, you need more help from experts.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Upgrade or refresh your skills.</strong> Attend certificate programs offered by your state and national pharmacy associations, schools of pharmacy, or other organizations. Become an expert in a disease such as diabetes or asthma. Offer services to support disease management and charge for them. Become a smoking-cessation expert. Go out and seek expertise in whatever excites your passion and promotes a higher standard of care. When you go for additional training in disease management, for example, stay in touch with the others who have been trained so that you can share successes and problems. Before leaving the training session, be sure someone is developing a workgroup or listserv through e-mail. That way, all of you can stay in touch and ask each other how problems with implementation, patient acceptance, payment, and so on are being resolved. Not having the support of others has been a critical barrier to implementing new service offerings.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"/><strong>Develop mentoring sites.</strong> Develop sites throughout your state where innovative practice is occurring, and use those sites as mentoring or apprenticeship sites. If your site is one of those, charge other pharmacists for this apprenticeship training. It is valuable, and we must stop giving away our value.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT SCHOOLS OF PHARMACY CAN DO</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is vital to understand that pharmaceutical care requires the development of problem-solving skills and abilities on the part of practitioners. A pharmacist must be able to anticipate, prevent, and solve drug-related problems; prioritize which problems need to be attended to first (in cooperation with the patient); develop action plans that include alternatives (including nondrug therapies); and justify these alternatives to patients, physicians, and third parties. This requires skills different from those needed to dispense prescriptions. Students must be exposed to patient care early on and throughout their pharmacy school experience.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, different teaching methods are needed. The accreditation standards of the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education have clearly spelled out competency areas and the need for new teaching methods and assessment techniques, but faculty members, like anyone else faced with change, have been somewhat reluctant to embrace many of these changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Arguments have been made, in the name of academic freedom, for the right to teach &#8220;what I want and how I want.&#8221; Of course, this is not at all what academic freedom is about. Courses and course objectives are determined by the faculty as a whole, not by an individual course instructor. A faculty member has the academic freedom to choose teaching means or methods that support the course objectives. Academic freedom does not allow a faculty member to lecture because he or she is more comfortable with lecturing, if this teaching method does not support course objectives. For example, a lecture is not sufficient for meeting the following objective: &#8220;The student shall be able to demonstrate caring and understanding.&#8221; This objective requires active, not passive, participation on the part of the student, through role-playing, group work, and so on. For students to demonstrate the ability to identify and prioritize drug-related problems and their solutions, more than a lecture is required. Thus, the provision of pharmaceutical care requires faculty members to incorporate different teaching methods, such as problem-based learning and small group participation. To do anything less than this is not responsible.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_19"/>Another area that needs to be revisited in schools of pharmacy is admissions criteria. We need to measure more than just prepharmacy grade point average (GPA). We need to look at indexes or validated scales that measure communication abilities and traits such as extroversion and introversion. Interviews should be developed that assess caring skills (or desire), what research the applicant has done to learn about changes in the profession, and the applicant&#8217;s problem-solving abilities. We need to attract people to the profession who can do more than just pass a class. We need people who care about people and what happens to them. As the profession changes and what pharmacists can do becomes more visible to the public, pharmacy school admissions screening will become easier.</p>
<p class="indent">Several years ago, a colleague and I did a study of communication apprehension and shyness in pharmacy students compared with nursing students. We found that one-fifth to one-fourth of pharmacy students were severely apprehensive about communicating and one-third were shy. These numbers are higher than population averages. Only one-seventh of nursing students were severely apprehensive about communicating, and just over one-tenth were shy. Why does nursing attract people who are less apprehensive and less shy than pharmacy students and the population in general? Probably because it is clearer that a person going into nursing will have to be directly involved in patient care, touching the patient, talking to the patient one-on-one, and so on. In community pharmacy, sufficient barriers still distance the pharmacist from the patient; this may be attractive to someone who wants to be in a health profession but is uncomfortable about communicating. As pharmacists&#8217; patient care activities become more visible, the profession will attract people who are less communication apprehensive and less shy.</p>
<p class="indent">Schools need to become far more serious about developing professional attitudes and behaviors on the part of our students. This is not magic. It takes work. Becoming a professional is a socialization process. We expect our students to act like professionals, to become professionals, simply because we have admitted them. Often, there is no formal process in place to make sure this actually occurs. We need to identify the attitudes and behaviors we expect and why these attitudes and behaviors are necessary and important, and then put the appropriate structure in place to make sure this occurs. I find it repugnant that we graduate individuals with great GPAs who couldn&#8217;t care less what happens to a patient. We have put a number of things in place to address this concern: an honor code, a professional development committee, an extensive orientation for new students, and pharmacy practice experiences. We have a long way to go, but we are making progress.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_20"/>Pharmaceutical care requires <em>care</em>. We need to teach our students about patient caring and the skills that go with that. We need to change how they think about patients. If we wait until their last year in school to expose them to patients, it is too little too late. The day our students are admitted they are assigned a patient. They are also assigned to two faculty mentors and a group that includes students from the first, second, and third year in our professional program. Fourth-year students are on rotation. The faculty mentors and all students meet each week to discuss the patients and the responsibilities we collectively need to take regarding any real or potential problems. All of us are responsible for all patients. Students mentor students and faculty mentor students. These activities include writing letters to physicians (with the patient&#8217;s permission) to address drug-related problems. There is much work to do to continue to develop these pharmacy practice experiences, but we are on the right track in regard to exposing students to patient care and taking responsibility for drug-related problems right from the start. If students do not know something because they have not learned it yet, they can ask a more senior student, or they will be assigned to look it up and report back to the group. Not knowing is not an excuse for not taking responsibility. When students become practitioners they will not know everything. They will need to know where to look.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, schools need to become as involved as possible with practice. We need to work with practitioners to develop practice sites, and we need studies to demonstrate the value of pharmacy services and continuing education. Many schools are developing (or have developed) external PharmD programs and disease management certificate programs. However, as previously mentioned, we also need to assist in the development of networks whereby these newly trained individuals can stay in contact to share successes and inquire about problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT STATE BOARDS OF PHARMACY CAN DO</h3>
<p class="noindent">Every one of us in pharmacy must critically evaluate what contribution we are making toward the incorporation of pharmaceutical care into all of pharmacy practice. We must be honest with ourselves about our responsibilities. This is what courage requires: honestly looking at ourselves. Practitioners must do this, schools of pharmacy must do this, and state boards must do this.</p>
<p class="indent">State boards of pharmacy exist to enforce the laws governing pharmacy practice. They exist to protect consumers, not pharmacists. There are still far too many pharmacies in this country that are either ignoring OBRA &#8217;90 or making the offer to counsel in far less than ethical ways. These actions put consumers at risk. It is not enough to say to a <a id="page_21"/>patient, &#8220;Sign here&#8221; or &#8220;Do you have any questions?&#8221; and act as though our professional, legal, and moral obligations have been met. Patients often don&#8217;t know what to ask or what they are signing. State boards know these practices exist; yet, at times, they take no action. We protect no one when this happens. Many state boards of pharmacy are understaffed, and this makes their work exceedingly difficult. But state boards must not allow unethical practices to continue. These practices hurt everyone. They lower our standards and make it difficult for the pharmacy profession to receive adequate recognition and compensation for needed services.</p>
<h3 class="h3">WHAT STATE AND NATIONAL PHARMACY ASSOCIATIONS CAN DO</h3>
<p class="noindent">State and national pharmacy associations must continue to provide courageous leadership and quality continuing education to pharmacists. Associations must continue to showcase exemplary practitioners who have changed their practice and advanced pharmaceutical care, but they must also be honest with members and have the courage to point out behaviors that are detrimental to consumers and practitioners. State and national pharmacy associations have been reluctant to discuss the actions of many pharmacists regarding OBRA &#8217;90. Waivers of rights to counseling must become unacceptable to all who practice pharmacy. State and national pharmacy associations must become part of this dialogue. We should not avoid these issues. Ethical behavior needs to be explored and discussed openly.</p>
<p class="indent">State and national pharmacy associations have always taken a leadership role in providing continuing education programs. This includes providing programs at annual meetings and developing disease management programs. I challenge the associations to consider the following:</p>
<p class="indentsquaret"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Short programs (1 to 2 hours) on most topics are not sufficient to produce significant change or knowledge of a topic. Consider longer programming blocks, interactive workshops, and multiple breakout sessions for enhanced learning. Lecturing to people for 1 to 2 hours without much interaction does not result in the needed problem-solving skills to render pharmaceutical care.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider that research has shown that pharmacists have differing degrees of readiness to render pharmaceutical care.<sup><a id="ch1-ref10" href="chapter1.xhtml#ch1_ref10">10</a></sup> Continuing education programs need to be tailored to the readiness of the practitioner. Most continuing education <a id="page_22"/>programs make the assumption that people are ready to take action, yet this is not the case. Some people are ready to go, while others need more information to understand concepts and overcome barriers. As more pharmacists begin providing pharmaceutical care, we hope to learn stage-specific factors that either facilitate or hinder a practitioner&#8217;s ability to render these services. In this way, continuing education programs can be targeted to the needs of individuals at different points along a continuum. Programs are more likely to be effective in this way.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider abandoning &#8220;name&#8221; speakers who cost a lot but offer little that meets the needs of practitioners. I am tired of going to national pharmacy association meetings and listening to professional athletes and coaches &#8220;motivate&#8221; me. How many people actually go to a national pharmacy association meeting because Joe Theismann, Bubba Smith, or Bobby Knight will be speaking? Their speakers&#8217; fees could be better spent on continuing pharmacist education and professional development. These speakers are often supported by major pharmaceutical companies, but could we not convince these companies that we would much prefer their support for programming that helps pharmacists make an impact on patient adherence and outcomes? I challenge state and national pharmacy associations to ask members if they want more targeted programming to help them move forward in patient care (and in getting compensated for it) instead of an hour with John Elway telling us how he won the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="indentsquare"><img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Image"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider using requests for proposal (RFPs) to attract speakers and quality programming. The membership and the program committee should set objectives for each continuing education program; speakers should not be setting the objectives. Publish the objectives for each needed session well in advance of the meeting and invite anyone to submit a proposal, with a budget, that describes the precise program and how it will meet the objectives. The qualifications of the individual should be part of the process. Obviously, speakers who claim they will engage attendees in problem-solving in a 1-hour lecture should not be considered; the method does not match the objective. This competitive process will increase the quality of continuing education and make it more innovative. Most important, it will more likely meet the needs of practitioners. Speakers who do not meet stated objectives may not be considered for future RFPs.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_23"/>SUMMARY</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter I have discussed caring, covenants, and codes and their relationship to pharmaceutical care. I have tried to identify what we need to do to advance pharmaceutical care and make it our standard, not just our mission. It will take commitment from all involved. We must each ask what contribution we can make and whether we are doing all that we can. We must be willing to critically evaluate what we are we doing to promote pharmacy and pharmaceutical care and how we may be contributing to barriers to this way of practice. I hope this chapter will stimulate introspection and discussion to move our profession forward. If this happens, patients will benefit greatly.</p>
