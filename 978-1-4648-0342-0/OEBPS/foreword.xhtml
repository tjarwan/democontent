<p class="noindent">As I write, the world is fighting to control the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a human tragedy that has cost thousands of lives and brought suffering to families and across entire com munities. The outbreak is a tragedy not only for those directly affected by the disease but also for their neighbors and fellow citizens. And the indirect, behavioral effects of the Ebola crisis&#x2014;slowing business activity, falling wages, and rising food prices&#x2014;will make life even more difficult for millions of people who already live in extreme poverty in that region of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of these behavioral effects are unavoidable. Ebola is a terrible disease, and quarantines and other public health measures are necessary parts of the response. At the same time, it is clear that the behavioral responses we are seeing, not just in West Africa but all over the world, are partly driven by stigma, inaccurate understanding of disease transmission, exaggerated panic, and other biases and cognitive illusions. Sadly, we have seen this happen before, with HIV/AIDS and the SARS and H1N1 influenza outbreaks, and we will likely see it again when we begin to prepare for the next outbreak. Societies are prone to forget what happened, and policy makers tend to focus on the most socially prominent risks, which are not always those that drive disease outbreaks.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of these risks, this year&#x2019;s <span class="italic">World Development Report&#x2014;Mind, Society, and Behavior</span>&#x2014;could not be more timely. Its main message is that, when it comes to understanding and changing human behavior, we can do better. Many development economists and practitioners believe that the &#x201C;irrational&#x201D; elements of human decision making are inscrutable or that they cancel each other out when large numbers of people interact, as in markets. Yet, we now know this is not the case. Recent research has advanced our understanding of the psychological, social, and cultural influences on decision making and human behavior and has demonstrated that they have a significant impact on development outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Research also shows that it is possible to harness these influences to achieve development goals. The Report describes an impressive set of results. It shows that insights into how people make decisions can lead to new interventions that help households to save more, firms to increase productivity, communities to reduce the prevalence of diseases, parents to improve cognitive development in children, and consumers to save energy. The promise of this approach to decision making and behavior is enormous, and its scope of application is extremely wide. Let me focus on a few themes.</p>
<p class="indent">First, it has implications for service delivery. Research shows that small differences in context, convenience, and salience have large effects on crucial choices, such as whether to send a child to school, prevent illness, or save to start a business. That means development practitioners need to focus not only on <span class="italic">what</span> interventions are needed but also on <span class="italic">how</span> they are implemented. That, in turn, requires implementing agencies to spend more time and resources experimenting, learning, and adapting during the intervention cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, as the risks and impact of climate change become clearer, we must use every tool at our disposal to confront the challenge. The Report describes how, in addition to taxes and subsidies, behavioral and social insights can help. These include reframing messages to emphasize the visible and palpable benefits of reducing emissions, and the use of social <a id="page_xii"/>norms to reduce energy consumption, social networks to motivate national commitments, and analogies to help people grasp climate forecasts.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, development professionals and policy makers are, like all human beings, subject to psychological biases. Governments and international institutions, including the World Bank Group, can implement measures to mitigate these biases, such as more rigorously diagnosing the mindsets of the people we are trying to help and introducing processes to reduce the effect of biases on internal deliberations.</p>
<p class="indent">The Ebola outbreak makes clear that misunderstanding and miscommunicating risks can have serious repercussions. Quarantining infected individuals can prove sensible, but trying to quarantine nations or entire ethnic groups violates human rights and may actually hinder efforts to control the outbreak of a disease. This year&#x2019;s <span class="italic">World Development Report</span> provides insight into how to address these and other current challenges and introduces an important new agenda for the development community going forward.</p>
