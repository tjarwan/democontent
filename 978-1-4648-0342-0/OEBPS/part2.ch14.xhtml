<h2 class="chapterTitle sky">Promoting water conservation in Colombia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Behind every intervention lies an assumption about human motivation and behavior. When a tunnel providing water to the city of Bogot&#x00E1;, Colombia, partially collapsed in 1997, triggering a water shortage, the city government declared a public emergency and initiated a communication program to warn inhabitants of the threat of a crisis: 70 percent of the city would be left without water if current water use was not reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">The city&#x2019;s strategy was based on the assumption that if individuals were informed of the situation, they would adjust their behavior and reduce usage&#x2014;after all, no one wants to be without water. But the assumption was wrong. In fact, the city&#x2019;s strategy <span class="italic">increased</span> water consumption. Many people did not change their behavior because they did not think they could make a difference and did not know which steps were most important. Some people even started to stockpile water.</p>
<p class="indent">Recognizing the mistake in its assumptions, the city government changed its strategy (Acosta 2009; Guillot 2014). First, the government reminded people to take action by conserving water at times when they were most likely to overuse it. Stickers featuring a picture of a statue of San Rafael&#x2014;which was the name of the emergency reservoir the city was relying on after the tunnel collapse&#x2014;were distributed throughout the city. People were asked to place a sticker by the faucet that a particular household, office, or school used most frequently. The stickers made the need to conserve water at all times salient. Daily reports of the city&#x2019;s water consumption were prominently published in the country&#x2019;s major newspapers. The reports became a part of public discussions about the emergency.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the city government launched engaging and entertaining campaigns to teach individuals the most effective techniques for household water conservation. The campaigns contained memorable slogans and organized 4,000 youth volunteers to go throughout the city to inform people about the emergency and teach them effective strategies to reduce consumption (<span class="italic">Formar Ciudad</span> [city development plan], 1995&#x2013;97). The mayor himself appeared in a TV ad taking a shower with his wife, explaining how the tap could be turned off while soaping and suggesting taking showers in pairs. Catholic priests were explicitly asked to invite their communities to join the cooperative efforts, which, in a religious country, proved to be particularly effective.</p>

<p class="sky">A change in strategy, building on conditional cooperation, helped create a new social norm to conserve.</p>

<p class="indent">Third, the city government publicized information about who was cooperating and who was not. The chief executive officer of the water company personally awarded households with exceptional water savings a poster of San Rafael with the legend, &#x201C;Here we follow a rational plan for using the precious liquid.&#x201D; These awards were made visible in the media. Three months later, when a second tunnel collapsed in the reservoir, the city imposed sanctions for <span class="italic">despilfarradores</span> (squanderers), those with the highest levels of overconsumption. While</p>

<p class="noindent">the sanctions were minor&#x2014;squanderers had to participate in a water-saving workshop and were subject to an extra day of water cuts&#x2014;they were nevertheless effective because they targeted highly visible actors. Car-washing businesses, although collectively not a major source of water waste, were the primary targets.</p>
<p class="indent">The assumption underlying the new strategy was that conservation would improve if the city created a greater scope for social rewards and punishments that helped to reassure people that achieving the public good&#x2014;continued access to water&#x2014;was likely (see <a href="part1.ch3.xhtml#WB.978-1-4648-0342-0.part1.ch3" class="xrefbook-part">chapter 2</a> for a fuller discussion of the dynamic of conditional cooperation, which may have undergirded the success of the city&#x2019;s revised strategy). This time, the assumption was correct. The change in strategy helped to create a social norm of water conservation. By the eighth week of the campaign, citywide water savings had significantly exceeded even the most optimistic technical predictions. Moreover, the reductions in water use persisted long after the tunnel was repaired and the emergency had been addressed (see <a href="part2.ch14.xhtml#WB.978-1-4648-0342-0.part2.ch14.fig1" class="xreffig">figure S5.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">This case study from Bogot&#x00E1; provides a real-world example of how interventions that take into account conditional cooperation may be useful for achieving policy goals.</p>
